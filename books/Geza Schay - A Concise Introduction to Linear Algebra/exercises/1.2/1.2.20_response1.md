### Answer 1.2.20

**a. Dot Product Decomposition:**
In an oblique system, we can't just multiply components.
However, the vector $\mathbf{p} = p^1 \mathbf{e}_1 + p^2 \mathbf{e}_2$ (where $\mathbf{e}$ are basis vectors along axes).
Also, the orthogonal projection length $p_1$ is related to the dot product with the axis direction.
The formula $\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{q} = p_1 q^1 + p_2 q^2$ represents summing the projection of one vector onto the axes multiplied by the component of the other vector along those axes. This works because $p_1 = \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{u}_1$ and $\mathbf{q} = q^1 \mathbf{u}_1 + \dots$ (roughly speaking).

**b. Metric Tensor Form:**
Let the basis vectors be $\mathbf{u}_1$ and $\mathbf{u}_2$.
$\mathbf{p} = p^1 \mathbf{u}_1 + p^2 \mathbf{u}_2$ and $\mathbf{q} = q^1 \mathbf{u}_1 + q^2 \mathbf{u}_2$.
$\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{q} = (p^1 \mathbf{u}_1 + p^2 \mathbf{u}_2) \cdot (q^1 \mathbf{u}_1 + q^2 \mathbf{u}_2)$.
Expand linearity:
$= p^1 q^1 (\mathbf{u}_1 \cdot \mathbf{u}_1) + p^1 q^2 (\mathbf{u}_1 \cdot \mathbf{u}_2) + p^2 q^1 (\mathbf{u}_2 \cdot \mathbf{u}_1) + p^2 q^2 (\mathbf{u}_2 \cdot \mathbf{u}_2)$.

The constants $g_{ij}$ are the dot products of the basis vectors:
$g_{11} = \mathbf{u}_1 \cdot \mathbf{u}_1$
$g_{12} = g_{21} = \mathbf{u}_1 \cdot \mathbf{u}_2$
$g_{22} = \mathbf{u}_2 \cdot \mathbf{u}_2$

Result: $\sum_{ij} g_{ij} p^i q^j$.
