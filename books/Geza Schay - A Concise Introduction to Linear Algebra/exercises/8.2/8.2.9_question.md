### Exercise 8.2.9

Enter the MATLAB commands `A = hilb(12)`, `c = ones(12,1)` and `b = A*c`. The matrix $A$ is the Hilbert matrix of order 12, defined by $a_{ij}=(i+j-1)^{-1}$ for $i, j=1,...,12$. It is extremely ill-conditioned; that is, it has a very high condition number. You can check this by entering `cond(A)`. The equation $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ should obviously have the solution $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{c}$. See what the MATLAB commands `x = A\b` and `x = rref([A b])` produce.
