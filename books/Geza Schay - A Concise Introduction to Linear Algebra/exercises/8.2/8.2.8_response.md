### Answer 8.2.8

**a. Sequence of Operations:**
`rrefmovie` likely performs standard Gauss-Jordan:
1. Normalize pivot row.
2. Eliminate all other rows (above and below).
Exercise 8.1.7 suggested Forward Elimination (to upper triangular) then Backward Substitution (or elimination from bottom up).
**Efficiency:** The 8.1.7 method (Gaussian Elimination + Back Sub) is significantly more efficient ($n^3/3$) than full Gauss-Jordan ($n^3/2$ or more depending on implementation) because back-substitution acts on vector/smaller system.
`flops` (if available in old MATLAB) would confirm this count.

**b. Pivot Order:**
MATLAB's `rref` usually picks the largest absolute value in the column as the pivot (Partial Pivoting) for numerical stability.
Example 8.2.2 might have used a strict top-down order without swapping.
**Preference:** The method with partial pivoting (MATLAB's default) is always preferable for numerical accuracy, even if operation counts are similar.
