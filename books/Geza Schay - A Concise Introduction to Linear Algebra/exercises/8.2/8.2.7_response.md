### Answer 8.2.7

**Matrices:**
$A$: Large entries in col 2, 3. Pivot 1 is 1.
$B$: Large entry in $a_{22}$.

**Observation:**
`rrefmovie` shows the steps.
For $A$, using $a_{11}=1$ as pivot involves subtracting row 1 from row 2.
$1 - 1(1) = 0$. $1 - 1(999999)$. Large numbers appear.
However, for $B$, the large number is already on the diagonal.
$B$ is likely to produce a more accurate result in limited precision because it doesn't require subtracting a huge number from a small one to define the pivot (or the pivot is already the large number if we swap).
Actually, the crucial part is the relative size of pivot vs elements below it.
In $A$, $a_{11}=1$ is small compared to nothing below it ($a_{21}=1$).
In $B$, $a_{22}$ is huge.
The problem highlights that large entries should ideally be used as pivots (Partial Pivoting logic) or scaling matters.
