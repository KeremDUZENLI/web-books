### Exercise 7.3.4

Find the principal axes of the ellipsoid given by the equation below, change its equation to standard form so that the left side becomes a sum of squares weighted with the eigenvalues as in Equation 7.118, and describe its position and shape.

$$
3x_{1}^{2}+3x_{2}^{2}+3x_{3}^{2}-2x_{1}x_{2}-2x_{1}x_{3}-2x_{2}x_{3}=4
$$
