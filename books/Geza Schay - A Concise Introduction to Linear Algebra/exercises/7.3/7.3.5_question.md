### Exercise 7.3.5

- a. Show that if $A$ is a symmetric matrix, then $\nabla(x^{T}Ax) = 2(Ax)^{T}$. (We have the transpose on the right because $\nabla f$, for every $f$, is usually considered to be a row vector.)

b. Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to show that the extreme values of $x^{T}Ax$ subject to the constraint $x^{T}x=1$ are eigenvalues of $A$. (This property of $A$ can be developed into a practical method for computing eigenvalues.)
