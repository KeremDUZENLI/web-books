### Exercise 7.3.8

The ellipse of Example 7.3.1, together with the corresponding one in standard position, can be plotted in MATLAB by using polar coordinates.

a. Enter the following program and explain the steps.

```matlab
t = 0:.1:2*pi;
c = cos(t); s = sin(t);
ra = 1./sqrt(.4*c.^2 -.6*c.*s +.85*s.^2);
rb = 1./sqrt(c.^2/4 + s.^2);
polar(t,ra)
hold
polar(t,rb)

```

b. An alternative program to plot the original ellipse directly from the matrix is the following. Enter it and explain the steps.

```matlab
A = [8, -6; -6, 17]/20;
t = 0:.2:2*pi;
x = [cos(t); sin(t)];
q = diag(x'*A*x)';
r = 1./sqrt(q);
polar(t,r)

```
