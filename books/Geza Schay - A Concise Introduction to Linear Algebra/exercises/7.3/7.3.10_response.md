### Answer 7.3.10

**Matrix:** $A = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ -1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}$.
This matrix is **not symmetric**.
Quadratic forms implicitly use the symmetric part of the matrix.
$x^T A x = x^T (\frac{A+A^T}{2}) x$.
Symmetric Part $S = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}$.
Equation: $4x_1^2 + 2x_2^2 = 1$.
This is a standard ellipse.
The defectiveness of non-symmetric $A$ (missing eigenvectors) is irrelevant to the shape of the quadratic form, which only "sees" the symmetric part. The symmetric part is always diagonalizable.
