### Exercise 7.3.7

- Prove the following theorem called Schur's lemma: For every real square matrix $A$ with only real eigenvalues there exists an orthogonal matrix $S$ such that $S^{-1}AS=T$ is upper triangular.

(Hint: Modify the proof of Theorem 7.3.2 to account for the possible lack of symmetry.)
