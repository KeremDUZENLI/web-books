### Answer 7.3.9

**MATLAB Code for Exercise 7.3.2:**
Matrix $A = [7, 24; 24, -7]$ and RHS 25.
Equation: $\mathbf{r}^T A \mathbf{r} = 25$. Radius $\rho = \sqrt{25 / (\mathbf{u}^T A \mathbf{u})}$.
Note: Since it's a hyperbola, $\mathbf{u}^T A \mathbf{u}$ will be negative in some directions. We must handle complex radii or mask them.

```matlab
A = [7, 24; 24, -7];
t = 0:0.05:2*pi;
x = [cos(t); sin(t)];
q = diag(x'*A*x)';
% Filter positive q for real radius
valid = q > 0;
r = NaN(size(q));
r(valid) = sqrt(25 ./ q(valid));
polar(t, r)
```
