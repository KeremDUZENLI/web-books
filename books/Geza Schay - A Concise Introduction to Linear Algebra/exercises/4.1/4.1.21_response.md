### Answer 4.1.21

**Problem:** $T(\mathbf{a}_i) = \mathbf{b}_i$.
$A$ is basis (source). $B$ is target vectors.
$[T] = B A^{-1}$.
Same matrices as Ex 3.6.23?
$A$ is standard basis matrix? No, specific matrix.
Solve $M A = B$.
$[T] = B A^{-1}$.
(Use MATLAB or row reduction $[A^T | B^T]$ then transpose result? No, $[A | B]$ row reduce? No, $A$ is on right.
$[A^T | B^T]$ reduces to $[I | M^T]$).
