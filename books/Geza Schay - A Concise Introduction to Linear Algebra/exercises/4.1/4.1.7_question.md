### Exercise 4.1.7

Find the matrix $[T]$ that represents the transformation of Exercise 4.1.4f above ($T(\mathbf{x}) = (\mathbf{a}^T \mathbf{x})\mathbf{b}$).

(This matrix is called the tensor product of $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{a}$ and is usually denoted by $\mathbf{b} \otimes \mathbf{a}$.)

It can also be expressed as an outer product (see Equation 2.105). How?
