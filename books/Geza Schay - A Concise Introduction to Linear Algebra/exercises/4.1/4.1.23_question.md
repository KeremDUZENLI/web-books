### Exercise 4.1.23

In MATLAB, polynomials are stored as row vectors of their coefficients in order of descending powers. For example, the polynomial $f(x) = 3x^2 - 2x + 1$ can be entered as `f = [3 -2 1]`. The product of polynomials is computed by the function `conv`. Thus, if $g(x) = 2x^2 + x$ and `g = [2 1 0]`, then `conv(f,g)` produces `[6 -1 2 1 0]`, corresponding to $f(x)g(x) = 6x^4 - x^3 + 2x^2 + x$.

a. Show by hand that if $f$ is the polynomial above and $p \in \mathcal{P}_4$ then the mapping $T$ from $\mathcal{P}_4$ to $\mathcal{P}_6$ given by $p \rightarrow \text{conv}(f,p)$ is linear.

b. Use MATLAB and judiciously selected values of $p$ to find the matrix $[T]$ of this transformation, that is, a matrix $[T]$ such that $[T]p = \text{conv}(f,p)$ for every $p \in \mathcal{P}_4$.
