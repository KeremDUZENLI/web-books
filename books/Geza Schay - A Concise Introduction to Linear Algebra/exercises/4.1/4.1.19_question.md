### Exercise 4.1.19

Let $U = \{p : p = p_0 + p_1x + \dots + p_n x^n\}$ be the space $\mathcal{P}_n$ of polynomials of degree $n$ or less together with the zero polynomial and $V = \{q : q = q_0 + q_1x + \dots + q_{n+1} x^{n+1}\}$ the space $\mathcal{P}_{n+1}$ of polynomials of degree $n + 1$ or less together with the zero polynomial.

Define the integration map $T$ from $U$ to $V$ by
$$
T(p) = T(p_0 + p_1x + \dots + p_n x^n) = p_0x + \frac{p_1 x^2}{2} + \dots + \frac{p_n x^{n+1}}{n+1}.
$$

Find the matrix $T_{A,B}$ that represents this transformation relative to the ordered bases $A = (1, x, \dots, x^n)$ and $B = (1, x, \dots, x^{n+1})$.
