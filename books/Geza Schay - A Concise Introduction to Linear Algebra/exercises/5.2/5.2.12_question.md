### Exercise 5.2.12

In $\mathbb{R}^3$ let a plane $S$ be given by the parametric equation $\mathbf{p} = (1, 2, 0)^T s + (1, 3, 5)^T t$.

a. Find the matrix of the projection onto $S$ and the matrix of the projection onto the normal vector of $S$.

b. Check that the sum of the projection matrices found in Part a is $I$.

c. Use the projection matrices found in Part a to decompose the vector $\mathbf{x} = (2, 3, 4)^T$ into a component in $S$ and one orthogonal to $S$.

d. Find the distance of the point $A = (2, 3, 4)$ from $S$.
