### Answer 5.2.2

**Equation 5.49:** For an orthonormal basis $\{\mathbf{q}_1, \dots, \mathbf{q}_k\}$ of subspace $U$, the projection matrix is $P = \sum_{i=1}^k \mathbf{q}_i \mathbf{q}_i^T$.

**Derivation:**
Let the orthonormal basis for the plane be $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}$.
Let $\mathbf{n}$ be the unit normal vector to the plane.
The set $\{\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{n}\}$ forms an orthonormal basis for $\mathbb{R}^3$.
Therefore, the identity matrix can be expressed as the sum of outer products of these basis vectors (Resolution of Identity):
$$ I = \mathbf{u}\mathbf{u}^T + \mathbf{v}\mathbf{v}^T + \mathbf{n}\mathbf{n}^T $$

The projection matrix $P$ onto the plane is given by the sum corresponding to the basis vectors of the plane:
$$ P = \mathbf{u}\mathbf{u}^T + \mathbf{v}\mathbf{v}^T $$

Rearranging the identity equation:
$$ \mathbf{u}\mathbf{u}^T + \mathbf{v}\mathbf{v}^T = I - \mathbf{n}\mathbf{n}^T $$

Thus, $P = I - \mathbf{n}\mathbf{n}^T$, which matches Equation 4.124.
