### Exercise 5.2.11

In $\mathbb{R}^3$ let a line $L$ be given by the parametric equation $\mathbf{p} = (1, 3, 5)^T t$.

a. Find the matrix of the projection onto $L$ and the matrix of the projection onto the orthogonal complement of $L$.

b. Check that the sum of the projection matrices found in Part a is $I$.

c. Use the projection matrices found in Part a to decompose the vector $\mathbf{x} = (2, 3, 4)^T$ into a component in $L$ and one orthogonal to $L$.

d. Find the distance of the point $A = (2, 3, 4)$ from $L$.
