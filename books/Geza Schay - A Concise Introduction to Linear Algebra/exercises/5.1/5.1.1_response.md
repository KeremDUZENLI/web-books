### Answer 5.1.1

**Goal:** Find a matrix $A$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with independent columns whose column space is the $x$-axis.

**Solution:**
The $x$-axis consists of vectors of the form $(x, 0, 0)^T$.
A basis for this subspace is the standard unit vector $\mathbf{e}_1 = (1, 0, 0)^T$.
We need a matrix $A$ whose columns span this space and are linearly independent.
Since the dimension is 1, $A$ will have 1 column.

$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} $$

(Any non-zero multiple of this vector would also work, e.g., $A = [2, 0, 0]^T$).
