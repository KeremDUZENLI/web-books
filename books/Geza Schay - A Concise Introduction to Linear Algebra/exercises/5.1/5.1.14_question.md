### Exercise 5.1.14

* Let $A$ be a matrix with independent rows.

a. Show that $AA^T$ is invertible.

b. Show that if $\mathbf{b}$ is any vector in $Col(A)$, then the equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ has a solution in $Row(A)$ given by $\mathbf{x}_R = A^T(AA^T)^{-1}\mathbf{b}$. (The matrix $A^T(AA^T)^{-1}$ is called the pseudoinverse of $A$, and is usually denoted by $A^+$. It is a right inverse of $A$, and coincides with the two-sided inverse $A^{-1}$ if $A$ is square.)

c. The mapping of $Col(A)$ to $Row(A)$ given by $\mathbf{x}_R = A^T(AA^T)^{-1}\mathbf{b}$ is an isomorphism.
