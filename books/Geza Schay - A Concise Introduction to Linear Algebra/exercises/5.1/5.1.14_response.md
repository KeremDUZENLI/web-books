### Answer 5.1.14

**Given:** $A$ ($m \times n$) has independent rows ($m \le n$, Rank $m$).

**a. $AA^T$ is invertible:**
$A^T$ has independent columns (Rank $m$).
$AA^T$ is an $m \times m$ matrix.
Since Rank($AA^T$) = Rank($A^T$) = $m$, the matrix is full rank and invertible.

**b. Right Inverse solution:**
We want to solve $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$.
Try $\mathbf{x}_R = A^T(AA^T)^{-1}\mathbf{b}$.
Substitute into equation:
$A(A^T(AA^T)^{-1}\mathbf{b}) = (AA^T)(AA^T)^{-1}\mathbf{b} = I\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{b}$.
Solution verified.
Is $\mathbf{x}_R \in Row(A)$?
Yes, $\mathbf{x}_R = A^T \mathbf{y}$ where $\mathbf{y} = (AA^T)^{-1}\mathbf{b}$.
Since it is a linear combination of columns of $A^T$ (rows of $A$), it is in the row space.

**c. Isomorphism:**
The map $\phi: Col(A) \to Row(A)$ defined by $\mathbf{b} \mapsto A^T(AA^T)^{-1}\mathbf{b}$ is the inverse of the map $T: Row(A) \to Col(A)$ defined by $\mathbf{x} \mapsto A\mathbf{x}$.
Since both maps are linear and inverses of each other (on these restricted subspaces), it is an isomorphism.
