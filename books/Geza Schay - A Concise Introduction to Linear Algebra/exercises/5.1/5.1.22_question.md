### Exercise 5.1.22

If the linear system $A\mathbf{s} = \mathbf{y}$ is overdetermined, that is, there are more equations than unknowns, then the MATLAB command `s = A\y` returns the solution of the corresponding normal system $A^T A\mathbf{s} = A^T\mathbf{y}$.

Use this command and Equations 5.25 through 5.28 to solve the problem of Example 5.1.3 with MATLAB.

Plot the result by also computing `z = s(1)*x + s(2)` or `z = polyval(s, x)` and entering the command `plot(x, y, 'o', x, z)`.
