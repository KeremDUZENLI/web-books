### Answer 5.1.5

**Proof:**
We are given that $\mathbf{p} \in Col(A)$. This means the system $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{p}$ is consistent (has at least one solution).
Since the columns of $A$ are independent, the solution to $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{p}$ is **unique**. Let's call it $\mathbf{x}^*$.

Now consider the normal equation $A^T A\mathbf{x} = A^T \mathbf{p}$.
Multiply the first equation by $A^T$:
$A^T (A\mathbf{x}^*) = A^T \mathbf{p}$.
So $\mathbf{x}^*$ is also a solution to the normal equation.

Is the solution to the normal equation unique?
The matrix of the normal system is $A^T A$.
Since the columns of $A$ are independent, $A^T A$ is invertible (nonsingular).
Therefore, the normal equation has exactly one unique solution.
Since $\mathbf{x}^*$ is a solution, it is *the* solution.

**Conclusion:** Both systems have the same unique solution $\mathbf{x}$.
