### Answer 5.1.17

**Equations:** The normal equations for line $y = mx + c$.
$A^T A \mathbf{x} = A^T \mathbf{y}$.
The second row of the normal system (corresponding to the intercept $c$) comes from the column of 1s in $A$.
Equation: $\sum (mx_i + c) = \sum y_i$.
$m \sum x_i + \sum c = \sum y_i$.
$m (m \bar{x}) + m c = m \bar{y}$ (where $m$ here is count of points, let's say $N$).
Divide by $N$:
$m \bar{x} + c = \bar{y}$.
This equation states exactly that the point $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$ satisfies the line equation.
Thus, the centroid lies on the least-squares line.
