### Answer 3.4.13

**Proof:**
Let $S = \{\mathbf{v}_1, \dots, \mathbf{v}_m\}$ with $m > n$.
Matrix $A$ is $n \times m$.
Homogeneous system $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ has $n$ equations and $m$ unknowns.
Since $m > n$, there must be free variables (at least $m-n$).
Free variables imply non-trivial solutions to $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$.
Thus, the columns are **linearly dependent**.
