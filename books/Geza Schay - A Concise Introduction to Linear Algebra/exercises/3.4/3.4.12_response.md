### Answer 3.4.12

**Proof:**
Let $S = \{\mathbf{v}_1, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n\}$ span $\mathbb{R}^n$.
Matrix $A$ has these columns. Rank($A$) must be $n$ (to span).
Since Rank is $n$ and there are $n$ columns, there are no free variables.
Thus $Null(A) = \{\mathbf{0}\}$, implying independence.
Since they span and are independent, they form a **basis**.
