### Answer 3.4.5

**Goal:** Matrix where first two rows of $A$ (transposed) are dependent, but first two rows of $U$ are independent.

**Example:**
$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 2 & 2 & 2 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} $$
Row 2 is a multiple of Row 1. They are dependent.
**Reduction:**
$R_2 \leftarrow R_2 - 2R_1$: $(0, 0, 0)$.
Swap $R_2, R_3$:
$$ U = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} $$
Rows of $U$: $(1, 1, 1)$ and $(0, 0, 1)$. These are independent.
Thus, the first two rows of $U$ form a basis, but the first two rows of $A$ did not.
