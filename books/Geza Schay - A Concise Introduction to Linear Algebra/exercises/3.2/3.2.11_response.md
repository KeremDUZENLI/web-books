### Answer 3.2.11

**No, the complement is never a subspace.**

**Reason:**
A subspace must contain the zero vector $\mathbf{0}$.
If $U$ is a subspace, $\mathbf{0} \in U$.
The complement $\overline{U}$ contains all vectors **not** in $U$.
Since $\mathbf{0} \in U$, it follows that $\mathbf{0} \notin \overline{U}$.
Failing to contain the zero vector means $\overline{U}$ is not a vector space.
