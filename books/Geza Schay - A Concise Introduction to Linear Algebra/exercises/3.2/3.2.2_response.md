### Answer 3.2.2

**Set:** $U=\{x \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid x_{1}=x_{2}^{2}\}$.

**Decision: No, this is not a subspace.**

**Proof (Counterexample):**
Check closure under scalar multiplication.
Let $\mathbf{u} = (1, 1, 0)$. This is in $U$ because $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2^2 = 1^2 = 1$.
Let $c = 2$.
$c\mathbf{u} = (2, 2, 0)$.
Check condition: Is $x_1 = x_2^2$?
$2 = 2^2 \implies 2 = 4$. This is false.
Since $c\mathbf{u} \notin U$, it is not a subspace.
