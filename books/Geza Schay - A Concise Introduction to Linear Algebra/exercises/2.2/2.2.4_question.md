### Exercise 2.2.4

Find conditions on a general vector $\mathbf{b}$ that would make the equation $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ consistent for the given matrix $A$:

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 \\
2 & -4 \\
-6 & 12
\end{bmatrix}
$$

(Hint: Reduce the augmented matrix using undetermined components $b_{i}$ of $\mathbf{b}$, until the $A$ in it is changed to echelon form, and set $c_{r+1}=c_{r+2}=\cdots=0.$)
