### Exercise 7.2.12

- In this exercise we outline an alternative approach to the solution of differential equations like $\frac{d\mathbf{u}}{dt}=A\mathbf{u}$ (Equation 7.99).
  Define, for every square matrix $A$ and every real $t$,
  $$
  e^{At}=I+At+\frac{(At)^{2}}{2!}+\frac{(At)^{3}}{3!}+\cdot\cdot\cdot
  $$
  assuming convergence and term-by-term differentiability.

a. Show that $\mathbf{u}(t)=e^{At}\mathbf{u}_{0}$ is the solution of Equation 7.99 satisfying the initial condition $\mathbf{u}(0)=\mathbf{u}_{0}$.

b. Show that if $A$ is diagonalizable so that $A=S\Lambda S^{-1}$, then $e^{At}=Se^{\Lambda t}S^{-1}$ where $e^{\Lambda t}$ is diagonal with entries $e^{\lambda_i t}$, and Equation 7.101 becomes $\mathbf{u}(t)=Se^{\Lambda t}S^{-1}\mathbf{u}_{0}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\mathbf{c}_{k}e^{\lambda_{k}t}$.

c. Use the above formalism to solve Equations 7.83 and 7.84 with $R=5$, $L=1$, $C=1/4$, and $\mathbf{u}_{0}=(0,10)^{T}$. Plot the graphs of the solution for $i$ and $q$.

d. Use Equations 7.100 and 7.101 to solve Equations 7.83 and 7.84 with $R=2$, $L=1$, $C=1$, and $\mathbf{u}_{0}=(0,10)^{T}$. Plot the graphs of the solution for $i$ and $q$.
