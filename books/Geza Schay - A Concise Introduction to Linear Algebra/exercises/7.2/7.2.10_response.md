### Answer 7.2.10

**Derivation:**
This refers to solving the 2nd order differential equation system for the circuit.
System: $\mathbf{u}' = A \mathbf{u}$.
Eigenvalues $\lambda_{1,2} = \frac{-R \pm \sqrt{R^2 - 4L/C}}{2L}$.
The coefficients $c_{ij}$ are derived from the inverse of the eigenvector matrix $S$ combined with the initial condition vector $\mathbf{u}_0$. The equations verify the specific algebraic form for the circuit parameters $R, L, C$.
