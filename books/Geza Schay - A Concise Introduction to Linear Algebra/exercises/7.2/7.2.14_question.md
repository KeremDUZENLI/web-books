### Exercise 7.2.14

In Exercise 7.2.11 the coefficient $r=-0.8$ represents the predation rate, that is, the number of prey caught per predator per month. Experiment with different values of $r$ to find one for which there is a stable limiting population. What is the split between the two kinds of animals in the limit for this $r$ as $k\rightarrow\infty$?
