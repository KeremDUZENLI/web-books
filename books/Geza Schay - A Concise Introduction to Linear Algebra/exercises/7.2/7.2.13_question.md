### Exercise 7.2.13

Consider the problem of Example 7.2.1 again.

a. Enter the matrix $A$ from Equation 7.59 ($A=\begin{bmatrix}1.1&0\\ 0.2&0.6\end{bmatrix}$) and use MATLAB to verify that Equation 7.61 leads to Equation 7.70.

b. Experiment with different death rates for the over fifty population, in place of the given 40%, to see what rates would lead to eventual extinction and what rate would lead to a steady population in the long run.

c. For what death rate would one of the eigenvalues equal 1? Compare this $A$ to those examined in Part b and explain.
