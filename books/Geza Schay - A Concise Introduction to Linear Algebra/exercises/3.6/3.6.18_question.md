### Exercise 3.6.18

* Show that similarity of matrices is an equivalence relation. (A relation $\sim$ is called an equivalence relation on a set $X$ if it is:
1. Reflexive, that is, $A \sim A$ holds for all $A$ in $X$,
2. Symmetric, that is, $A \sim B$ implies $B \sim A$ for all $A, B$ in $X$, and
3. Transitive, that is, $A \sim B$ and $B \sim C$ imply $A \sim C$ for all $A, B, C$ in $X$.)
