### Exercise 3.6.11

a. Find a formula that gives an arbitrary third degree polynomial as a linear combination of the first four Legendre polynomials: $L_{0}(x)=1$, $L_{1}(x)=x$, $L_{2}(x)=\frac{1}{2}(3x^{2}-1)$, and $L_{3}(x)=\frac{1}{2}(5x^{3}-3x)$.

b. Express the polynomial $P(x)=1-2x+3x^{2}-4x^{3}$ as a linear combination of these Legendre polynomials.
