### Exercise 3.6.24

Let
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 1 & 4 & -1 & 0 \\
3 & 4 & 0 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\
1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 0 & 3 \\
0 & 0 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 0 \\
2 & 4 & 4 & 6 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$
(Note: Snippet 1462 has an extra row of zeros in the 4th row? "0 0 2 2 3 0 0" has 7 entries. Wait, let's look closely at 1462: "0 0 2 2 3 0 0" is on one line, "2 4 4 6 0 0" on next. It looks like a 6x6 matrix. The 4th row has 7 entries in snippet? "0 0 2 2 3 0 0". Ah, maybe it's just a typo in the snippet extraction or the matrix is 6x6. Let's assume standard 6x6 structure based on other rows having 6 elements.)

Use the MATLAB command `rref` to find a basis matrix for $Col(A)$. The command `C = orth(A)` creates another basis matrix $C$ for $Col(A)$. Find the transition matrix $S$ from the basis $B$ to the basis $C$. (Hint: By Theorem 3.6.2 you need to solve $BS = C$.)
