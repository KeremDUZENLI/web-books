### Answer 3.6.8

**Explanation:**
To find the transition matrix $S$ such that $P_A S = P_B$, we need to solve for $S$.
This is equivalent to solving the matrix equation $P_A X = P_B$ for $X$.
If we view this column by column, for the $j$-th column $\mathbf{s}_j$ of $S$ and $\mathbf{b}_j$ of $P_B$, we are solving the linear system $P_A \mathbf{s}_j = \mathbf{b}_j$.
The row reduction of the augmented matrix $[P_A \mid P_B]$ performs the elimination steps required to transform $P_A$ into the identity matrix $I$.
Applying these same operations to $P_B$ transforms it into $P_A^{-1} P_B$, which is exactly the solution $S$.
Thus, $[P_A \mid P_B] \sim [I \mid P_A^{-1} P_B] = [I \mid S]$.
