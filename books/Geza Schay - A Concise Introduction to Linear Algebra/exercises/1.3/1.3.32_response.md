### Answer 1.3.32

**Equation 1.83:** $\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{p} = d$ (where $|\mathbf{n}|=1$).

**Geometric Meaning:**
In $\mathbb{R}^2$, this is the **Hesse Normal Form** of a line.
* $\mathbf{n}$ is the unit normal vector perpendicular to the line.
* $d$ is the signed distance from the origin to the line.

**Drawing:**

Draw a line. Draw a perpendicular segment from the origin to the line. The length of this segment is $|d|$. The direction of the segment is $\mathbf{n}$ (or $-\mathbf{n}$ if $d<0$). Any point $\mathbf{p}$ on the line satisfies the projection onto $\mathbf{n}$ equals $d$.
