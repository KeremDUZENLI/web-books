### Exercise 1.3.37

Find an equation for the normal transverse $L$ of the lines given in Exercise 1.3.29.
(This term means the line connecting the given ones orthogonally.)

Hint: First, find the direction vector $\mathbf{v}$ of $L$, then a plane $S$ containing $\mathbf{v}$ and one of the given lines, and last, the point of intersection of $S$ and the other line.
