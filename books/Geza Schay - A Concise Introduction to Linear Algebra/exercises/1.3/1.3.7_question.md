### Exercise 1.3.7

Find equations for the line through $P_0(5, 4, -8)$ and parallel both to the plane given by $3x - 4y + 3z = 7$ and to the $xy$-plane in both parametric and nonparametric forms.

Hint: The direction vector of the line sought must be orthogonal to the normal vectors of the two planes.
