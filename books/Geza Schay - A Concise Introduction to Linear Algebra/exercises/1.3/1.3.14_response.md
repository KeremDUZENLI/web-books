### Answer 1.3.14

**Given:** Plane through $O$ and **orthogonal** to line $\mathbf{p} = (3, -2, 1) + t(2, 1, -3)$.

1.  **Find Normal:**
    Since the plane is orthogonal to the line, the line's direction vector is the plane's normal vector.
    $\mathbf{n} = (2, 1, -3)$.

2.  **Nonparametric Form:**
    Plane through origin with normal $\mathbf{n}$:
    $2x + 1y - 3z = 0$.

3.  **Parametric Form:**
    We need two vectors orthogonal to $\mathbf{n} = (2, 1, -3)$.
    * Guess $\mathbf{u} = (1, -2, 0)$ (dot product is $2-2=0$).
    * Guess $\mathbf{v} = (0, 3, 1)$ (dot product is $3-3=0$).
    $\mathbf{p} = s(1, -2, 0) + t(0, 3, 1)$.
