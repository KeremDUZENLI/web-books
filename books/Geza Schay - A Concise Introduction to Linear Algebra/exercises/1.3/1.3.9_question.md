### Exercise 1.3.9

a. Plot the lines $\mathbf{p} = (4, 3) + t(2, -3)$ and $\mathbf{p} = (3, 2) + t(-1, 4)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, indicating the points with $t = 0, \pm 1$ on each.

b. Explain why there is no common $t$ value for the point of intersection.

c. Change the parameterization of each line (that is, write new equations for them, employing a new parameter) so that the new common parameter, say $s$, is 0 for both lines at the point of intersection.
