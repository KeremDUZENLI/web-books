### Exercise 6.3.5

The expression $\mathbf{u}\cdot(\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{w})$ of Statement 11 of Theorem 6.3.1 is called the triple product of these vectors. Show geometrically that its absolute value equals the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the vectors $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v},$ and $\mathbf{w}$.
