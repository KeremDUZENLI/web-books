### Answer 2.1.16

**Matrix from Eq 2.20:**
(Referring to Ex 2.1.6):
$$ \left[ \begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 & 0 & -1 & 1 \\ -2 & 3 & -1 & 0 \\ -6 & 6 & 0 & -2 \end{array} \right] $$
Solution: $\mathbf{x} = (1, 2/3, 0) + t(1, 1, 1)$.

**Interpretation:**
1.  Intersection of all three is the line $\mathbf{p} + t(1,1,1)$.
2.  Intersection of Plane 1 and Plane 2: A line with direction $(1,1,1)$.
3.  Intersection of Plane 2 and Plane 3: A line with direction $(1,1,1)$.
4.  Intersection of Plane 1 and Plane 3: A line with direction $(1,1,1)$.
Since the system is consistent for all three, they actually meet at a single common line.
*Correction:* The problem asks to show they have **parallel** lines of intersection. This usually implies the system is inconsistent (like a triangular prism pipe), but the planes intersect pairwise in parallel lines.
Let's check the matrix for **Ex 2.1.7** (which had no solution).
$$ \left[ \begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 & 0 & -1 & 1 \\ -2 & 3 & -1 & 0 \\ -6 & 6 & 0 & 0 \end{array} \right] $$
This system was inconsistent ($0=2$).
However, the **coefficient matrix** is the same as 2.1.5 and 2.1.6.
The normal vectors are the same.
The direction of intersection for any pair is given by the cross product of normals, or the kernel of the coefficient matrix.
Kernel is $t(1,1,1)$.
Therefore, the intersection of Pair(1,2) is a line parallel to $(1,1,1)$.
Intersection of Pair(2,3) is a line parallel to $(1,1,1)$.
Intersection of Pair(1,3) is a line parallel to $(1,1,1)$.
Since there is no common point (inconsistent system), these three lines are distinct and parallel.
