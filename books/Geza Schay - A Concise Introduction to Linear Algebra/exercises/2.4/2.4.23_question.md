### Exercise 2.4.23

Partition the first matrix of the previous exercise as:

$$
\left[\begin{array}{c|ccc}
1 & -2 & 1 & 0 \\
3 & 4 & 0 & 1 \\
\hline
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]
$$

Find the appropriate corresponding partition of the second matrix, and evaluate the product by using these blocks.
