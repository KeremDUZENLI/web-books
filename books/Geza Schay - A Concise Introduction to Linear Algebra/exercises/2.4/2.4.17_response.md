### Answer 2.4.17

Example 2.4.8 refers to a connectivity matrix $M$ for a graph (cities B, D usually indices 2, 4).
Let's assume the standard square connectivity example graph.
If B is index 2 and D is index 4.
$(M^3)_{24}$ represents the number of walks of length exactly 3 from node 2 to node 4.
Without the specific matrix $M$ from the text, the calculation method is:
1.  Compute $M^2 = M \times M$.
2.  Compute $M^3 = M^2 \times M$.
3.  Read the entry in row 2, column 4.
