### Answer 2.4.13

**a. Sum of outer products:**
$AB = \sum_{k=1}^p (\text{col}_k \text{ of } A)(\text{row}_k \text{ of } B)$.
$a_k$ is the $k$-th column of $A$. $b^k$ is the $k$-th row of $B$.
Each term $a_k b^k$ is an $m \times n$ matrix.
The $(i,j)$ entry of the sum is $\sum_{k=1}^p (a_k)_i (b^k)_j = \sum_{k=1}^p a_{ik} b_{kj}$, which is the standard definition.

**b. Rows of $AB$:**
The $i$-th row of $AB$, denoted $(AB)_i$, is the product of the $i$-th row of $A$ (denoted $a_i$) with the matrix $B$.
$(AB)_i = a_i B$.
This is a linear combination of the rows of $B$ using coefficients from row $i$ of $A$.
The formula $(AB)_i = \sum_{j=1}^p a_{ij} b^j$ expresses this (where $b^j$ is the $j$-th row of $B$).

**c. Columns of $AB$:**
The $j$-th column of $AB$, denoted $(AB)^j$, is the product of matrix $A$ with the $j$-th column of $B$ (denoted $b_j$).
$(AB)^j = A b_j$.
This is a linear combination of the columns of $A$ using coefficients from column $j$ of $B$.
Formula: $(AB)^j = \sum_{i=1}^p a^i b_{ij}$ (where $a^i$ is the $i$-th column of $A$).
