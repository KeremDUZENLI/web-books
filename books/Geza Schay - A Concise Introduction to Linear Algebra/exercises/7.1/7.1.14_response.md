### Answer 7.1.14

**Proof:**
The characteristic polynomial of $A$ is $p(\lambda) = \det(A - \lambda I)$.
The characteristic polynomial of $A^T$ is $q(\lambda) = \det(A^T - \lambda I)$.
Note that $(A - \lambda I)^T = A^T - \lambda I^T = A^T - \lambda I$.
Since $\det(M) = \det(M^T)$ for any square matrix:
$q(\lambda) = \det(A^T - \lambda I) = \det((A - \lambda I)^T) = \det(A - \lambda I) = p(\lambda)$.
Since the polynomials are identical, their roots (eigenvalues) are identical.
