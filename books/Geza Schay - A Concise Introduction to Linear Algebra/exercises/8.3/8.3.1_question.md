### Exercise 8.3.1

a. Apply the method of Theorem 8.3.1 to the matrix

$$
A=\begin{bmatrix}3&0&1\\ 0&3&0\\ 0&0&1\end{bmatrix}
$$

of Example 7.1.3 of page 257. Use $k=1$, first with the initial vector $(1,1,1)^{T}$ and second, with the initial vector $x_{0}=(1,-1,1)^{T}$.

b. How would you modify Theorem 8.3.1 in the case in which there is a dominant eigenvalue of multiplicity 2 or more?
