### Answer 6.1.5

**Case $n=1$:**
A matrix $A = [a_{11}]$.
**Axiom 1 (Identity):** $det(I) = det([1]) = 1$. (Matches $a_{11}$).
**Axiom 2 (Row Swap):** Requires at least two rows to swap. This axiom is vacuous (applies to no cases) for $n=1$.
**Axiom 3 (Linearity):** $det([c a_{11} + d b_{11}]) = c a_{11} + d b_{11} = c det([a_{11}]) + d det([b_{11}])$. This holds.

Since Axiom 2 is not applicable, the determinant is defined solely by Axiom 1 and 3, leading to $det(A) = a_{11}$.
