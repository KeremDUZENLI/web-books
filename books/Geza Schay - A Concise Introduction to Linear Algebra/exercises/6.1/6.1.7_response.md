### Answer 6.1.7



**Proof for Lower Triangular Matrices:**
$$ A = \begin{vmatrix} a_{11} & 0 & 0 \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & 0 \\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \end{vmatrix} $$
By the property that $det(A) = det(A^T)$:
The transpose of a lower triangular matrix is an upper triangular matrix with the same diagonal entries.
From Theorem 6.1.7, the determinant of an upper triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal entries.
$$ det(A) = det(A^T) = a_{11} a_{22} a_{33} $$
This logic holds for any size $n$.
