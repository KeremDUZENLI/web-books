### Answer 6.1.19

**Code Analysis:**
1.  `x = randperm(n)`: Random permutation.
2.  `I = eye(n)`: Identity matrix.
3.  Loop `P(i,:) = I(x(i),:)`: This explicitly constructs a Permutation Matrix $P$.
    The $i$-th row of $P$ is the $x(i)$-th row of the Identity.
    This shuffles the rows of $I$ according to the permutation `x`.
4.  `det(P)`: Calculates the sign of the permutation ($\pm 1$).
    This code is more efficient than solving the linear system `B\A` because it constructs $P$ directly rather than computing inverses or factorizations of full matrices.
