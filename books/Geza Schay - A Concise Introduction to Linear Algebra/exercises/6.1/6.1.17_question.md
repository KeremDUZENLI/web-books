### Exercise 6.1.17

Let `A = round(10*rand(5))` and `x = round(10*rand(5, 1))`.

a. Create a matrix $B$ by entering `B = A; B(:,4) = x`. What does this do?

b. Create matrices as above, in which the third column of $A$ is replaced by multiples of random vectors and use these to illustrate the linear dependence of the det function on the third column.

c. Is $det(A)+det(B)$ equal to $det(A+B)$ in general, when $A$ and $B$ are the same size? Experiment with random matrices. Explain.

d. Let $A$ be as above and compute `B = A; B(:,4) = B(:,4) + 3*B(:,1)`. Compare $det(A)$ and $det(B)$. Explain.
