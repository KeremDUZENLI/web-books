### Answer 8.1.8

**Matrix Inversion $[A|I] \to [I|A^{-1}]$:**
1.  **Forward ($A \to U$):**
    We perform row ops on $A$ ($n^3/3$) and on $I$.
    Operations on $I$: Initially 0s, filling in.
    Roughly, the cost is same as LU on the $I$ part? No.
    Total ops for Gaussian elimination on $n \times 2n$ matrix:
    $\approx \frac{1}{3} n (2n)^2$? No.
    Strict analysis:
    Forward on A: $n^3/3$.
    Forward on I: $\approx n^3/3$ (triangle fills up).
    Total Forward $\approx 2n^3/3$.
    Backward ($U \to I$) on $[U | L^{-1}]$:
    Eliminate above diagonal. Square matrix part.
    Ops $\approx n^3/2$?
    **Standard Result:** Gauss-Jordan inversion takes $\approx n^3$ operations.
    (Compared to LU which is $n^3/3$, but LU produces factors, not the full inverse. To get inverse from LU requires solving $n$ systems $\approx n(n^2) = n^3$).
    So Inversion is $3 \times$ more expensive than Factorization.
