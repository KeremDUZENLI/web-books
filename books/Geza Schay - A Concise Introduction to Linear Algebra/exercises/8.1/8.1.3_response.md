### Answer 8.1.3

**Proof:**
Let $A$ be symmetric ($A = A^T$).
Let $A = L D U$ be the LDU factorization, where $L$ is unit lower triangular, $U$ is unit upper triangular, and $D$ is diagonal.
Transpose $A$:
$A^T = (L D U)^T = U^T D^T L^T$.
Since $D$ is diagonal, $D^T = D$.
$A^T = U^T D L^T$.
Since $A = A^T$, we have $L D U = U^T D L^T$.
Uniqueness of LDU factorization:
The factorization into (Unit Lower) $\times$ (Diagonal) $\times$ (Unit Upper) is unique.
Looking at $U^T D L^T$:
* $U^T$ is Unit Lower Triangular (transpose of unit upper).
* $L^T$ is Unit Upper Triangular (transpose of unit lower).
Comparing $L D U$ with $(U^T) D (L^T)$:
By uniqueness, the unit lower parts must match, and unit upper parts must match.
Therefore, $L = U^T$ and $U = L^T$.
Thus, for a symmetric matrix, the $U$ in LDU is $L^T$.
