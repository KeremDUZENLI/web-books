### Answer 8.1.9

**Determinant Calculation:**
1.  **Reduce to Triangular Form $U$:**
    Use Gaussian elimination.
    Cost: $\approx n^3/3$ operations.
2.  **Product of Diagonals:**
    $\det(A) = (-1)^s \prod u_{ii}$.
    Cost: $n-1$ multiplications. Negligible.

**Total:**
The cost is dominated by the reduction step: $\approx n^3/3$.
