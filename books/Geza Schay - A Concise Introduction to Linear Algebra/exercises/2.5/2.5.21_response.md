### Answer 2.5.21

**Conjecture:**
If $B$ is an upper triangular matrix with non-zero diagonal entries (ensured by the random generation usually, though integers might create 0), its inverse $B^{-1}$ is also **upper triangular**.
If $C$ is lower triangular, its inverse $C^{-1}$ is **lower triangular**.

**Proof:**
Augment $[B|I]$.
$B$ is already in row echelon form (mostly).
Row operations to reduce to $I$ only involve subtracting lower rows from upper rows.
These operations on the $I$ matrix (which starts diagonal) preserve the upper triangular structure.
(e.g., $R_1 \leftarrow R_1 + kR_2$ adds elements to the right of the diagonal).
Thus the inverse remains upper triangular.
