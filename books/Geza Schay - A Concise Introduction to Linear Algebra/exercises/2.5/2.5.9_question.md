### Exercise 2.5.9

a. Given the $3 \times 2$ matrix
$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 \\ 4 & -1 \\ 2 & 2 \end{bmatrix} $$
find all $2 \times 3$ matrices $X$ by Gauss-Jordan elimination such that $XA = I$ holds. (Such a matrix is called a left inverse of $A$.)

b. Can you find a $2 \times 3$ matrix $Y$ such that $AY = I$ holds?
