### Exercise 2.3.7

Find two particular solutions $\mathbf{x}_b$ and $\mathbf{x}'_b$ of the given system and the general solution $\mathbf{v}$ of the corresponding homogeneous system. Write the general solution of the given system as $\mathbf{x}_b + \mathbf{v}$ and also as $\mathbf{x}'_b + \mathbf{v}$ and show that the two forms are equivalent; that is, that the set of vectors of the form $\mathbf{x}_b + \mathbf{v}$ is identical with the set of vectors of the form $\mathbf{x}'_b + \mathbf{v}$.

\begin{aligned}
2x_1 + 3x_2 - 1x_3 &= 4 \\
3x_1 + 5x_2 + 2x_3 &= 1
\end{aligned}
