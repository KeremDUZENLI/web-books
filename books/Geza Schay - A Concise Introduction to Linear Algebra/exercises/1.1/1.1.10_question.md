### Exercise 1.1.10

Let $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c}, \mathbf{d}$ be the position vectors of the vertices of a tetrahedron. The point given by $\mathbf{p}=\frac{1}{4}(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}+\mathbf{d})$ is the tetrahedron's centroid.

Show that it lies one fourth of the way from the centroid of the vertices of any face to the opposite vertex on the line joining these points.
