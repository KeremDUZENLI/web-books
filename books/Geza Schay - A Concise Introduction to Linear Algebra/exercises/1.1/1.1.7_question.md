### Exercise 1.1.7

Given $n$ point masses $m_{i}$, $i=1,2,...,n$ at the points with position vectors $\mathbf{r}_{i}$ in either two or three dimensions, their center of mass is defined as the point with position vector $\mathbf{r}=\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{i}\mathbf{r}_{i}$, where $M=\sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{i}$ is the total mass.

If three mass points are given with $m_{1}=2, m_{2}=3, m_{3}=5$, and $\mathbf{r}_{1}=(2,-1,4)$, $\mathbf{r}_{2}=(1,5,-6)$, $\mathbf{r}_{3}=(-2,-5,4)$, find $\mathbf{r}$.
