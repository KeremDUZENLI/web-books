### Exercise 4.2.8

* Prove that if $T$ is a linear transformation from a vector space $U$ onto a vector space $V$, and $dim(U) = dim(V)$, then $T$ is an isomorphism.

(Hint: First show that if $\mathcal{B} = \{\mathbf{b}_1, \mathbf{b}_2, \dots, \mathbf{b}_n\}$ is a basis for $V$ and $T(\mathbf{a}_i) = \mathbf{b}_i$, for $i = 1, 2, \dots, n$, then the $\mathbf{a}_i$ form a basis for $U$.)
