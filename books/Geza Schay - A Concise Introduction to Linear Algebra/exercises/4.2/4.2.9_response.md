### Answer 4.2.9

**Proof:**
$T$ is 1-to-1 $\implies dim(Ker(T)) = 0$.
Rank-Nullity: $dim(U) = 0 + dim(Range(T))$.
So $dim(Range(T)) = dim(U)$.
Given $dim(U) = dim(V)$.
So $dim(Range(T)) = dim(V)$.
Since $Range(T)$ is a subspace of $V$ with the same dimension, $Range(T) = V$.
$T$ is Onto.
Since 1-to-1 and Onto, it is an isomorphism.
