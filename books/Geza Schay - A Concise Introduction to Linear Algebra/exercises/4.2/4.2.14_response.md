### Answer 4.2.14

**a. $f = [3, -2, 1]$ ($3x^2 - 2x + 1$).**
Convolution of $f$ (deg 2) with $p$ (deg 4) $\to$ deg 6.
Matrix $[T]$ is Toeplitz $7 \times 5$ (mapping coords of $p_4$ to $p_6$).
Structure: Diagonals are 3, -2, 1.
Columns are shifted $f$.
Since $f \neq 0$, the columns are linearly independent (multiplication by non-zero polynomial does not map non-zero to zero in integral domain).
Rank is 5 (full rank).
**Kernel:** $\{\mathbf{0}\}$.
**Range:** Subspace of $\mathcal{P}_6$ spanned by $\{f, xf, x^2f, x^3f, x^4f\}$. (Multiples of $f$).

**b. $f = [3, -2, 0]$ ($3x^2 - 2x$).**
Roots: $x(3x-2)$.
Still non-zero.
Kernel is $\{\mathbf{0}\}$.
Range is multiples of $f$.
