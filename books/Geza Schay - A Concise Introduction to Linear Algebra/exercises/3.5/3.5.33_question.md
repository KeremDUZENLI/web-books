### Exercise 3.5.33

* Prove the following alternative algorithm for obtaining a basis for the left null space of a matrix:

Let $A$ be any real $m \times n$ matrix of rank $r$. Consider the block matrix $[A \mid I]$, where $I$ is the unit matrix of order $m$. Reduce this block matrix by elementary row operations to a form $\begin{bmatrix} U & L \\ O & M \end{bmatrix}$ in which $U$ is an $r \times n$ echelon matrix and $O$ the $(m-r) \times n$ zero matrix. Then the transposed rows of the $(m-r) \times m$ matrix $M$ form a basis for the left null space of $A$.

(Hint: For any $b \in Col(A)$ reduce $Ax = Ib$ by elementary row operations until $A$ is in an echelon form $\begin{bmatrix} U \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$ with $U$ having no zero rows. On the right-hand side denote the result of this reduction of the matrix $I$ by $\begin{bmatrix} L \\ M \end{bmatrix}$ and consider the condition for consistency.)
