### Exercise 3.5.36

* Show that the result of Exercise 3.5.33 can be used to solve $Ax = b$ by the following new algorithm:

Let $A$ be any real $m \times n$ matrix and $b \in Col(A)$. Reduce the block matrix $\begin{bmatrix} A^T & I \\ -b^T & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ to the form $\begin{bmatrix} U & L \\ 0 & x^T \end{bmatrix}$ by elementary row operations without ever exchanging the last row or multiplying it by a scalar, where $U$ is an $n \times m$ echelon matrix and $x^T$ a row $n$-vector. Then the latter is the transpose of a particular solution $x$. The general solution is given by the sum of this $x$ and any linear combination of the transposed rows of $L$ that correspond to the zero rows of $U$.
