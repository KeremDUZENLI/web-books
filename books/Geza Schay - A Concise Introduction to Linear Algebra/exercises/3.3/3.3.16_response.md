### Answer 3.3.16

**Proof:**
Let the vectors be $\mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2, \mathbf{a}_3$.
Construct matrix $A = [\mathbf{a}_1 \ \mathbf{a}_2 \ \mathbf{a}_3]$.
Since they are independent, the homogeneous system $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}$ has only the trivial solution.
This implies $A$ has 3 pivots (Full Rank).
Since $A$ is $3 \times 3$ and has rank 3, it is invertible.
For any $\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^3$, the system $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ has a solution ($\mathbf{x} = A^{-1}\mathbf{b}$).
Thus, every vector $\mathbf{b}$ is a linear combination of the columns.
They span $\mathbb{R}^3$.
