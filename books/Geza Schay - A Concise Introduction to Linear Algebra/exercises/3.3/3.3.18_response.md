### Answer 3.3.18

**Proof:**
A square matrix $A$ is singular $\iff \det(A) = 0$ (or Rank $< n$).
Rank $< n \iff$ The columns are linearly dependent (by the Invertible Matrix Theorem / definition of rank and independence).
Specifically:
If columns are dependent, there is non-trivial $\mathbf{x}$ such that $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$.
This means $A$ is not invertible (singular).
Conversely, if $A$ is singular, $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ has non-trivial solutions, implying columns are dependent.
