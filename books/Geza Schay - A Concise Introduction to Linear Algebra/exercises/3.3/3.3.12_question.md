### Exercise 3.3.12

Let $\mathbf{a}_{1}$ and $\mathbf{a}_{2}$ be independent vectors in a vector space $X$, and $\mathbf{v}$ another vector of $X$, not in $\text{Span}\{\mathbf{a}_{1}, \mathbf{a}_{2}\}$.

Prove, using Definition 3.3.1, that the vectors $\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{a}_{1}, \mathbf{a}_{2}$ are independent of each other.

(Hint: Prove this indirectly by assuming that the three vectors are dependent and showing that that assumption leads to a contradiction.)
