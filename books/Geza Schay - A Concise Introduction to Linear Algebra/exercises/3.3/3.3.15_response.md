### Answer 3.3.15

**Proof:**
Let there be $n$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$, with $n > 3$.
Construct matrix $A$ ($3 \times n$).
The system $A\mathbf{s} = \mathbf{0}$ represents the dependency relation.
This is a homogeneous system with 3 equations and $n$ unknowns.
Since number of unknowns ($n$) > number of equations (3), there are free variables (at least $n-3$).
Therefore, non-trivial solutions exist.
Thus, the columns are linearly dependent.
