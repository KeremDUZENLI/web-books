### Answer 3.3.17

**Proof:**
Let $\mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2, \mathbf{a}_3$ span $\mathbb{R}^3$.
Matrix $A$ ($3 \times 3$) has columns spanning $\mathbb{R}^3$.
This means $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ is consistent for all $\mathbf{b}$.
This implies Rank$(A) = 3$ (must have a pivot in every row).
Since it is a square matrix with Rank 3, it also has a pivot in every column.
Therefore, $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$ has only the trivial solution.
The vectors are independent.
