### Answer 3.3.1

**Proposition:** Three vectors $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}$ are dependent $\iff$ one is a linear combination of the others.

**Proof ($\Rightarrow$):**
Assume $\{\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w}\}$ is dependent.
Then there exist scalars $c_1, c_2, c_3$ not all zero such that $c_1\mathbf{u} + c_2\mathbf{v} + c_3\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{0}$.
Suppose (without loss of generality) that $c_1 \neq 0$.
We can solve for $\mathbf{u}$:
$\mathbf{u} = -\frac{c_2}{c_1}\mathbf{v} - \frac{c_3}{c_1}\mathbf{w}$.
Thus $\mathbf{u}$ is a linear combination of $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{w}$.

**Proof ($\Leftarrow$):**
Assume one vector is a combination of the others, e.g., $\mathbf{u} = k_1\mathbf{v} + k_2\mathbf{w}$.
Rearrange: $1\mathbf{u} - k_1\mathbf{v} - k_2\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{0}$.
Since the coefficient of $\mathbf{u}$ is $1$ (nonzero), there is a non-trivial combination equalling zero.
Thus, the set is dependent.
