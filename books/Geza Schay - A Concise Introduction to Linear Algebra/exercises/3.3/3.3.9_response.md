### Answer 3.3.9

**Vectors:** $\mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2, \mathbf{a}_3$ from Ex 3.3.5.
$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 4 & 0 \\ 2 & -3 & 5 \\ 1 & 2 & -1 \end{bmatrix} $$

**Statement:** **Dependent.**

**Proof:**
From Ex 3.3.5/3.3.6 reduction, we found that the homogeneous system (and specific systems) led to dependent rows/cols.
Specifically, in 3.3.6, we saw $x_2 - x_3 = -1$ was consistent with $x_2 - x_3 = -1$, leading to infinite solutions.
For $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}$, we get $x_2 - x_3 = 0 \implies x_2=x_3$.
Solution $\mathbf{x} = t(-1, 1, 1)$.
Since there is a non-zero solution to $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}$ (e.g., $-\mathbf{a}_1 + \mathbf{a}_2 + \mathbf{a}_3 = \mathbf{0}$), they are dependent.
