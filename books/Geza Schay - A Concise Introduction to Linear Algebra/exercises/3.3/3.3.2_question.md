### Exercise 3.3.2

Show directly that, in every vector space $X$, if the decomposition of a vector $\mathbf{b}$ into a linear combination of given vectors $\mathbf{a}_i$ is not unique, then the decomposition of every other decomposable vector $\mathbf{c}$ is also not unique.

(Hint: Write $\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{b}$ with different decompositions for the two $\mathbf{b}$ vectors.)
