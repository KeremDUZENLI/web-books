### Answer 6.2.20

**Proof:**
The unit square is spanned by $\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2$. Area = 1.
$T$ maps $\mathbf{e}_1 \to \mathbf{c}_1$ (col 1 of T) and $\mathbf{e}_2 \to \mathbf{c}_2$.
The image is the parallelogram spanned by $\mathbf{c}_1, \mathbf{c}_2$.
The area of a parallelogram spanned by two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by them.
Area $= |det([\mathbf{c}_1 \mathbf{c}_2])| = |det([T])|$.
Thus Area$_{new} = |det(T)| \times \text{Area}_{old}$.
