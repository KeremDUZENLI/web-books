### Answer 6.2.14

**Equation:**
$$ \begin{vmatrix} x & y & 1 \\ x_1 & y_1 & 1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = 0 $$
1.  **Linearity:** Expansion along row 1 gives $x(y_1-y_2) - y(x_1-x_2) + 1(...) = 0$. This is linear in $x$ and $y$ ($Ax + By + C = 0$), so it represents a line.
2.  **Points on Line:**
    If $(x,y) = (x_1, y_1)$, row 1 equals row 2. Determinant is 0. Point is on line.
    If $(x,y) = (x_2, y_2)$, row 1 equals row 3. Determinant is 0. Point is on line.
Since it is a line containing both points, it is *the* line through them.
