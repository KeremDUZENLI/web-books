### Exercise 3.1.15

Let $V$ denote the set of all ordered quintuples of 0's and 1's, with addition defined by the MATLAB command `plq` and multiplication by scalars by `c&p`.

a. Generate such vectors by the command `round(rand(1,5))` and use MATLAB to check whether each of the eight vector space axioms is satisfied for those vectors and selected scalars.

b. If you think this set is a vector space, prove it. If not, explain why.

c. Do you get a vector space if the scalars are also restricted to 0's and 1's and their addition and multiplication are also defined by `c|d` and `c&d`, respectively?
