### Answer 3.1.1

**Yes, this is a vector space.**

1.  **Closure under addition:** Adding two polynomials of degree at most 2 results in a polynomial of degree at most 2.
    $(ax^2 + bx + c) + (dx^2 + ex + f) = (a+d)x^2 + (b+e)x + (c+f)$.
2.  **Closure under scalar multiplication:** Multiplying by a scalar $k$ keeps the degree at most 2.
    $k(ax^2 + bx + c) = (ka)x^2 + (kb)x + (kc)$.
3.  **Zero Vector:** The zero polynomial ($0x^2 + 0x + 0$) is included in the set.
4.  **Inverses:** For any $p(x)$, $-p(x)$ is also of degree at most 2.

All 8 axioms are satisfied.
