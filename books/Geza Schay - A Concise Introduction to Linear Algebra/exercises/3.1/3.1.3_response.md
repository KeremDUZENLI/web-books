### Answer 3.1.3

**No, this is not a vector space.**

**Reason 1 (Zero Vector):**
The zero vector $(0,0)$ is not in the set because $2(0) + 3(0) = 0 \neq 1$.
Every vector space must contain the zero vector.

**Reason 2 (Closure under addition):**
If $\mathbf{u}$ is in the set ($2x_1+3y_1=1$) and $\mathbf{v}$ is in the set ($2x_2+3y_2=1$), then for $\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v}$:
$2(x_1+x_2) + 3(y_1+y_2) = (2x_1+3y_1) + (2x_2+3y_2) = 1 + 1 = 2 \neq 1$.
The sum falls outside the set.
