# Chapter 2.5: The Inverse and the Transpose of a Matrix

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter defines the matrix inverse as the algebraic "undo" button for linear transformations, enabling the reversal of operations.

- It introduces a practical algorithm for computing the inverse by applying Gauss-Jordan elimination to an augmented matrix $[A|I]$, linking the solvability of systems to the property of invertibility.

## Keywords

**Inverse Matrix ($A^{-1}$):**

- A unique square matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix $A$ (from left or right), yields the identity matrix $I$.

**Invertible (Nonsingular):**

- A square matrix that has an inverse; this requires the matrix to have full rank (rows are linearly independent).

**Matrix Equation $AX=I$:**

- The equation solved to find the inverse, which essentially solves $n$ separate linear systems simultaneously ($Ax_i = e_i$) to find the columns of the inverse.

## Formulas

**Inverse Definition**

- **Formula:** $AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I$

- **Meaning:** Applying a transformation and then its inverse results in no change (Identity).

- **Use in graphics:** Concatenating the "Camera" transformation and the "View" transformation (which is the Camera's inverse) to render scenes.

**Algorithm for Inversion**

- **Formula:** $[A | I] \xrightarrow{\text{row reduce}} [I | A^{-1}]$

- **Meaning:** If you perform operations to turn $A$ into Identity, applying those same operations to Identity creates $A^{-1}$.

- **Use in graphics:** Computing the inverse of a View matrix or Projection matrix in a graphics engine.

**Solution via Inverse**

- **Formula:** $x = A^{-1}b$

- **Meaning:** If the inverse exists, the solution to a linear system is simply the inverse multiplied by the constant vector.

- **Use in graphics:** Converting mouse coordinates (screen space) back into world coordinates (un-projecting).

## Practical Use

**Camera transformations**

- The "View Matrix" used in shaders is actually the inverse of the camera's world transformation matrix; it moves the whole world so the camera is at the origin.

**Coordinate Space Conversion**

- Moving vertices between different coordinate spaces (e.g., from Model Space to World Space, or Tangent Space to Object Space) often requires computing and applying inverse matrices.

**Undoing Operations**

- In editing software, if an object is scaled and rotated, applying the inverse matrix restores it to its original shape and orientation.
