# Chapter 7.3: Principal Axes

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter applies the spectral theorem (diagonalization) to symmetric matrices, which are crucial because they always have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

- It focuses on the **Principal Axis Theorem**, which states that any quadratic form (like the equation of an ellipsoid) can be transformed into a simple sum of squares by rotating the coordinate system to align with the matrix's eigenvectors (the principal axes).

## Keywords

**Principal Axis Theorem:**

- A theorem stating that for every symmetric matrix $A$, there exists an orthogonal matrix $S$ such that $S^{-1}AS$ is a diagonal matrix. Geometrically, this means there is a coordinate system (the principal axes) where the transformation acts purely as scaling along the axes.

**Quadratic Form ($Q(x)$):**

- A function $Q(x) = x^T A x$ where $A$ is a symmetric matrix. These forms describe geometric shapes like ellipses, hyperbolas, and paraboloids.

**Symmetric Matrix:**

- A matrix where $A^T = A$. Its key properties are that all its eigenvalues are real and eigenvectors belonging to different eigenvalues are orthogonal.

**Spectrum:**

- The set of all eigenvalues of a matrix.

## Formulas

**Orthogonal Diagonalization**

- **Formula:** $S^{-1}AS = \Lambda$ or $A = S\Lambda S^{-1}$ (where $S$ is orthogonal, so $S^{-1} = S^T$).

- **Meaning:** Any symmetric matrix can be decomposed into a rotation ($S^T$), a scaling along the axes ($\Lambda$), and a rotation back ($S$).

**Quadratic Form Expansion**

- **Formula:** $Q(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}x_i x_j$

- **Meaning:** The algebraic expression of a quadratic form involves squared terms ($x_i^2$) and cross-product terms ($x_i x_j$).

**Principal Axes Transformation**

- **Formula:** $\sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i y_i^2 = 1$

- **Meaning:** By changing to the coordinate system defined by the eigenvectors ($y$), the complex cross-product terms disappear, leaving a simple weighted sum of squares.

## Practical Use

**Shape Analysis**

- Determining the shape and orientation of conic sections (ellipses, hyperbolas). The eigenvectors point along the major and minor axes of the shape, and the eigenvalues determine the lengths of these axes.

**Physics (Moment of Inertia)**

- In rigid body dynamics, the "inertia tensor" is a symmetric matrix. Finding its principal axes simplifies rotational equations (Euler's equations) significantly because the body rotates stably around these axes.

**Stress and Strain**

- In mechanics, the stress tensor is symmetric. Diagonalizing it finds the "principal stresses" (normal stresses) acting on planes where the shear stress is zero.
