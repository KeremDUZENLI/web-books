# Chapter 7.4: Complex Matrices

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter generalizes linear algebra concepts from real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$) to complex numbers ($\mathbb{C}$).

- It addresses the necessity of handling complex eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which naturally arise even in real matrices (like rotation matrices).

- It introduces **Hermitian** and **Unitary** matrices as the complex analogs of Symmetric and Orthogonal matrices, establishing their critical properties regarding eigenvalues and diagonalization.

## Keywords

**Complex Vector Space ($\mathbb{C}^n$):**

- The set of vectors where each component is a complex number. Operations like addition and scaling work similarly to $\mathbb{R}^n$, but scalars are complex.

**Hermitian Conjugate ($A^H$ or $A^\dagger$):**

- The combined operation of transposing a matrix and taking the complex conjugate of every entry. For vectors, $z^H = \overline{z}^T$.

**Hermitian Matrix:**

- A square matrix that is equal to its own Hermitian conjugate ($A^H = A$). It is the complex equivalent of a symmetric matrix and is guaranteed to have **real eigenvalues**.

**Unitary Matrix:**

- A square matrix whose inverse is its Hermitian conjugate ($U^H U = I$). It is the complex equivalent of an orthogonal matrix and preserves length and angles (generalized).

**Inner Product ($x^H y$):**

- The generalization of the dot product for complex vectors. The first vector must be conjugated to ensure that the length of a vector ($x^H x$) is a real, non-negative number.

## Formulas

**Complex Length (Norm)**

- **Formula:** $|z| = \sqrt{|z_1|^2 + \dots + |z_n|^2} = \sqrt{z^H z}$

- **Meaning:** The length is calculated using the square of the absolute values (modulus) of the components to ensure the result is a real number.

**Hermitian Conjugate Definition**

- **Formula:** $(A^H)_{ij} = \overline{a_{ji}}$

- **Meaning:** To find the entry at row $i$, column $j$ of the conjugate transpose, look at row $j$, column $i$ of the original matrix and take its complex conjugate.

**Real Eigenvalues Theorem**

- **Formula:** If $A^H = A$, then $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$.

- **Meaning:** Any Hermitian matrix (and thus any real symmetric matrix) has purely real eigenvalues, which is physically significant in measuring observable quantities.

**Unitary Eigenvalues**

- **Formula:** If $U^H U = I$, then $|\lambda| = 1$.

- **Meaning:** The eigenvalues of a unitary matrix lie on the unit circle in the complex plane, representing rotations or phase shifts without stretching.

## Practical Use

**Quantum Mechanics**

- This is the primary application field. Physical observables (like energy or momentum) are represented by **Hermitian operators** because measurements must yield real values (eigenvalues).

- The evolution of a quantum system is described by **Unitary matrices** (via Schrödinger's equation), ensuring that total probability remains 1 (probability is conserved).

**Signal Processing**

- The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) matrix is a Unitary matrix. It decomposes signals into frequencies without altering the total energy (Parseval's theorem).

**Control Theory**

- Analyzing the stability of systems where oscillations occur (complex eigenvalues imply rotation/oscillation).
