# Chapter 3.4: Bases

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter introduces the **basis**: a "Goldilocks" set of vectors that is just right—large enough to cover the entire space (span) but small enough to contain no redundancies (independent).

- It provides the algorithms for extracting these efficient building blocks from any matrix, which is essential in computer graphics for defining local coordinate systems (like "Object Space" vs. "World Space") and compressing data.

## Keywords

**Basis:**

- A set of vectors that is both **linearly independent** and **spans** the vector space; it provides a unique coordinate system for that space.

**Standard Basis:**

- The most natural basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$ consisting of the unit vectors $e_1, e_2, \dots, e_n$ (e.g., the X, Y, Z axes).

**Column Space (Col(A)):**

- The subspace spanned by the columns of a matrix; a basis for it is found by identifying the **pivot columns** in the echelon form and selecting the corresponding columns from the _original_ matrix.

**Row Space (Row(A)):**

- The subspace spanned by the rows of a matrix; a basis for it is simply the **non-zero rows** of the matrix after reduction to echelon form.

## Formulas

**Unique Representation**

- **Formula:** $\mathbf{x} = c_1 \mathbf{b}_1 + \dots + c_n \mathbf{b}_n$

- **Meaning:** Every vector in the space can be written in exactly one way as a combination of the basis vectors.

- **Use in graphics:** Uniquely identifying a vertex position relative to a model's center.

**Basis for Column Space**

- **Method:** Reduce $A \to U$. If columns $1$ and $3$ of $U$ have pivots, then columns $1$ and $3$ of **$A$** are the basis.

- **Meaning:** We keep only the "original" directions that add new dimensions.

- **Use in graphics:** Determining the independent directions of motion in a robotic arm.

**Basis for Row Space**

- **Method:** Reduce $A \to U$. The non-zero rows of **$U$** are the basis.

- **Meaning:** Row operations don't change the span of the rows, so the simplified rows work perfectly.

- **Use in graphics:** Simplifying systems of linear constraints.

## Practical Use

**Coordinate Systems**

- Every 3D model has a "local basis" (Right, Up, Forward vectors). Rendering essentially involves converting coordinates from this local basis to the camera's basis.

**Dimensionality Reduction**

- If you have a cloud of data points (like motion capture markers), finding a basis tells you the true number of parameters needed to describe the motion, allowing you to discard redundant data.

**Extending Vectors**

- If you have one vector (like a surface normal), you can extend it to a full basis to create a coordinate system aligned with that surface (used in "Tangent Space" normal mapping).
