# Chapter 2.4: The Algebra of Matrices

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter establishes the algebraic rules for matrices—specifically addition, scalar multiplication, and matrix multiplication—treating them as operators that map vectors from one space to another.

- It is the mathematical backbone of the graphics pipeline, as matrix multiplication allows multiple geometric transformations (like rotation, scaling, and translation) to be "composed" into a single, efficient matrix.

## Keywords

**Matrix Multiplication:**

- An operation that combines two matrices to represent applying two linear mappings in succession; it is generally **not commutative** (order matters).

**Identity Matrix ($I$):**

- A square matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere that acts like the number 1; multiplying a matrix by $I$ leaves it unchanged.

**Conformability:**

- The rule that for a product $AB$ to exist, the number of columns in $A$ must equal the number of rows in $B$.

**Zero Matrix ($O$):**

- A matrix consisting entirely of zeros that acts as the additive identity.

## Formulas

**Matrix Addition**

- **Formula:** $(A + B)_{ij} = A_{ij} + B_{ij}$

- **Meaning:** Adds corresponding entries of two matrices of the same dimensions.

- **Use in graphics:** Accumulating displacement maps or morph targets.

**Matrix Multiplication (Dot Product Rule)**

- **Formula:** $(AB)_{ik} = \sum_j A_{ij} B_{jk}$

- **Meaning:** The entry at row $i$, column $k$ is the dot product of the $i$-th row of $A$ and the $k$-th column of $B$.

- **Use in graphics:** Concatenating Model, View, and Projection matrices into a single MVP matrix.

**Associativity**

- **Formula:** $A(BC) = (AB)C$

- **Meaning:** You can group matrix operations however you like, provided the left-to-right order stays the same.

- **Use in graphics:** Pre-calculating a static "View-Projection" matrix to apply to thousands of dynamic objects efficiently.

**Identity Transformation**

- **Formula:** $AI = IA = A$

- **Meaning:** The identity matrix represents a "no-op" or neutral transformation.

- **Use in graphics:** Initializing the transformation stack (glLoadIdentity).

## Practical Use

**Transformation Composition**

- Combining a rotation, scale, and translation into one matrix so the GPU only has to multiply each vertex once, rather than three times.

**Graph Connectivity**

- Using matrix multiplication on adjacency matrices (e.g., calculating $M^2$ or $M^3$) to find connections or paths between nodes in a scene graph or network.

**State Transitions**

- Modeling discrete time-step simulations (like population growth or particle decay) by repeatedly multiplying a state vector by a transition matrix.
