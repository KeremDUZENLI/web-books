# Chapter 7.2: Diagonalization of Matrices

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter introduces **diagonalization**, a process that decomposes a square matrix $A$ into a product $S\Lambda S^{-1}$, where $\Lambda$ is a simple diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.

- This technique is powerful because it "uncouples" the variables in a system, allowing complex matrix powers ($A^k$) and systems of differential equations to be solved easily by treating each dimension independently.

## Keywords

**Diagonalization:**

- The process of finding a basis of eigenvectors (forming matrix $S$) that transforms a matrix $A$ into a diagonal matrix $\Lambda$. A matrix is diagonalizable if and only if it has a full set of linearly independent eigenvectors.

**Diagonal Matrix ($\Lambda$):**

- A matrix where all entries outside the main diagonal are zero. Operations like raising to a power are trivial (just raise the diagonal numbers to that power).

**Similarity Transformation:**

- The operation $S^{-1}AS = \Lambda$. Matrices $A$ and $\Lambda$ are "similar," meaning they represent the same linear transformation but in different coordinate systems.

**Difference Equations:**

- Equations describing discrete changes over steps (like $x_{n+1} = Ax_n$); diagonalization solves these by easily computing $A^n$.

## Formulas

**Diagonalization Formula**

- **Formula:** $A = S\Lambda S^{-1}$ or $S^{-1}AS = \Lambda$

- **Meaning:** Matrix $A$ can be rewritten using its eigenvalues (in $\Lambda$) and eigenvectors (columns of $S$).

**Matrix Powers**

- **Formula:** $A^k = S \Lambda^k S^{-1}$

- **Meaning:** To calculate the $k$-th power of a matrix, you only need to raise the eigenvalues to the power of $k$, which is computationally very fast.

**Decoupled Differential Equations**

- **Formula:** If $v = S^{-1}u$, then $\frac{dv}{dt} = \Lambda v \implies v_i(t) = C_i e^{\lambda_i t}$

- **Meaning:** In the basis of eigenvectors, a complex system of mixing rates becomes a set of independent, simple exponential growth or decay equations.

## Practical Use

**Population Dynamics**

- Predicting long-term population trends (e.g., age distribution) over many years by modeling the transition as a matrix $A$ and computing $A^n$ using diagonalization.

**Electrical Circuits**

- Solving RLC circuits (Resistor, Inductor, Capacitor) involves coupled differential equations. Diagonalization decouples the current and charge variables, making the system solvable.

**Efficient Computation**

- Instead of multiplying a matrix by itself 100 times to simulate 100 time steps, you can just take the 100th power of the diagonal numbers, vastly speeding up simulations in physics and engineering.
