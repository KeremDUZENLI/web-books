# Chapter 1.1: Vectors

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter introduces vectors as geometric quantities possessing both magnitude and direction, distinguishing between "bound" position vectors and "free" vectors for representing physical quantities.

- It establishes the algebraic rules for vector addition and scalar multiplication in $\mathbb{R}^n$, which are the fundamental building blocks for representing 3D geometry, transformations, and motion in computer graphics.

## Keywords

**Position Vector:**

- A vector bound to the origin of a coordinate system used to identify the specific location of a point in space.

**Free Vector:**

- A class of equivalent parallel arrows with the same length and direction, used to represent quantities like velocity or displacement that are not tied to a specific location.

**Parallelogram Law:**

- A geometric definition of vector addition where the sum of two vectors corresponds to the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by them.

**Scalar:**

- A real number used to multiply a vector, scaling its length (and reversing direction if negative) while maintaining its line of action.

## Formulas

**Vector Addition (Component-wise)**

- **Formula:** $(p_1, p_2) + (q_1, q_2) = (p_1 + q_1, p_2 + q_2)$

- **Meaning:** Adds the corresponding components of vectors to form a new vector.

- **Use in graphics:** Combining displacements (e.g., moving a character) or accumulating forces.

**Scalar Multiplication**

- **Formula:** $c(p_1, p_2) = (cp_1, cp_2)$

- **Meaning:** Scales every component of the vector by the number $c$.

- **Use in graphics:** Resizing objects, reversing vectors (using -1), or adjusting speed.

**Vector Subtraction**

- **Formula:** $p - q = (p_1 - q_1, p_2 - q_2)$

- **Meaning:** The vector pointing from point Q to point P.

- **Use in graphics:** Calculating the vector between two points (e.g., vector from surface to light source).

**Midpoint Formula**

- **Formula:** $m = \frac{1}{2}(p + q)$

- **Meaning:** The average of two position vectors, locating the point exactly in the middle.

- **Use in graphics:** Finding the center of an edge or subdividing geometry.

## Practical Use

**Locating Points**

- Using position vectors to define the vertices of 2D or 3D models relative to an origin

**Modeling Displacement**

- Using free vectors to describe the movement of an object from one position to another without reference to the origin

**Center of Mass**

- Calculating the centroid of geometric shapes (like triangles or tetrahedrons) by averaging their vertex vectors
