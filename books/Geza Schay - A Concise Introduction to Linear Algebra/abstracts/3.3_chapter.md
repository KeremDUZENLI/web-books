# Chapter 3.3: Span and Independence of Vectors

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter focuses on determining if a set of vectors contains redundant information (dependence) or if every vector adds a new dimension to the space (independence).

- It establishes that checking for independence is equivalent to checking if a linear system has a unique solution; this is crucial in graphics for defining efficient coordinate systems where every point has a unique address.

## Keywords

**Linear Combination:**

- A vector formed by scaling a set of vectors and adding them together; solving $As=b$ is essentially asking "is $b$ a linear combination of the columns of $A$?"

**Linear Independence:**

- A property of a set of vectors where no vector in the set can be built from the others; mathematically, the only way to combine them to get zero is to multiply them all by zero.

**Linear Dependence:**

- The opposite of independence; it means at least one vector is redundant (it is a linear combination of the others) and can be removed without shrinking the span.

**Trivial Solution:**

- The solution where all coefficients are zero ($s_i = 0$); if this is the _only_ solution to $\sum s_i a_i = 0$, the vectors are independent.

## Formulas

**Independence Test**

- **Formula:** $\sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i a_i = 0 \implies s_1 = s_2 = \dots = 0$

- **Meaning:** If the only way to stack the vectors to return to the origin is to not move at all, they are independent.

- **Use in graphics:** Ensuring a set of basis vectors actually defines a full coordinate system (non-degenerate).

**Dependence Condition**

- **Formula:** $a_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} c_i a_i$

- **Meaning:** At least one vector ($a_k$) is just a mix of the previous ones and provides no new geometric direction.

- **Use in graphics:** Detecting redundant data points or vertices that lie on the same line/plane.

**Matrix Form of Independence**

- **Formula:** $As = 0$ has only the solution $s=0$.

- **Meaning:** The columns of matrix $A$ are independent if the homogeneous system has no non-zero solutions.

- **Use in graphics:** Checking if a transformation matrix squashes space (singular) or preserves dimensions (invertible).

## Practical Use

**Unique Coordinates**

- If vectors are independent, any point in their span has exactly one unique set of coordinates (coefficients); if they are dependent, a point could be described in infinite ways, which crashes algorithms.

**Geometric Checks**

- **Two vectors:** Dependent if parallel (collinear).
- **Three vectors:** Dependent if they lie on the same plane (coplanar). This is used to check for degenerate polygons that shouldn't be rendered.

**Minimal Storage**

- Identifying dependent vectors allows developers to "prune" data sets, keeping only the essential vectors needed to define a mesh or motion path.
