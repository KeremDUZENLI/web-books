# Chapter 4.2: Properties of Linear Transformations

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter defines the fundamental attributes of linear transformations—specifically the **Range** (outputs) and **Kernel** (inputs that vanish)—and establishes the conditions for invertibility (Isomorphism).

- It proves that the abstract behavior of a linear transformation is perfectly mirrored by the algebraic properties (Rank and Nullity) of its representative matrix, validating the use of matrices to analyze geometric operations.

## Keywords

**Range (Image):**

- The set of all possible output vectors produced by the transformation; it corresponds exactly to the **Column Space** of the representative matrix.

**Kernel (Ker(T)):**

- The set of all input vectors that the transformation maps to the zero vector; it corresponds exactly to the **Null Space** of the representative matrix.

**One-to-One (Injective):**

- A property where distinct inputs always map to distinct outputs (no information is lost/flattened); this occurs if and only if the Kernel contains only the zero vector.

**Isomorphism:**

- A transformation that is both one-to-one and onto (covers the whole output space); it functions as a perfect dictionary, translating vectors between two spaces without losing structure.

**Rank & Nullity:**

- The dimensions of the Range and the Kernel, respectively; they measure the "size" of the output and the "size" of the collapsed dimensions.

## Formulas

**Rank-Nullity Theorem (Transformations)**

- **Formula:** $rank(T) + nullity(T) = dim(Domain)$

- **Meaning:** The dimension of the input space is split between the dimensions that are preserved (Rank) and the dimensions that are collapsed to zero (Nullity).

- **Use in graphics:** Determining if a projection preserves enough information to reconstruct the 3D scene or if depth data is irretrievably lost.

**Composition of Transformations**

- **Formula:** $(S \circ R)(x) = S(R(x))$

- **Meaning:** Applying transformation $R$ followed by $S$ is equivalent to a single combined transformation.

- **Use in graphics:** Determining the final position of a robot's fingertip by combining the rotations of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist.

**Matrix of Composition**

- **Formula:** $[S \circ R] = [S][R]$

- **Meaning:** The matrix representing a sequence of transformations is simply the product of their individual matrices.

- **Use in graphics:** Pre-multiplying a stack of matrices (Model-View-Projection) into one matrix to speed up vertex processing.

**Sum of Transformations**

- **Formula:** $(S + T)(x) = S(x) + T(x)$

- **Meaning:** Transformations can be added together to create new linear transformations.

- **Use in graphics:** Morphing meshes by blending between two different shape states (linear interpolation).

## Practical Use

**Detecting Singularities**

- If the Kernel of a transformation is not zero (Nullity > 0), the transformation flattens space (like a 3D object projected onto a 2D screen), meaning you cannot mathematically "undo" (invert) the operation to get the original 3D points back.

**Scene Graphs**

- In game engines, objects are often children of other objects. Their absolute world position is calculated by composing the local transformations of every parent object up the hierarchy chain.

**Data Equivalent**

- The concept of isomorphism tells us that any $n$-dimensional vector space is essentially just $\mathbb{R}^n$ in disguise. This allows graphics programmers to treat polynomials, colors, or audio signals as simple coordinate lists.
