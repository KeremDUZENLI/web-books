# Chapter 4.1: Representation of Linear Transformations by Matrices

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter bridges the gap between abstract functions and linear algebra by showing that every linear transformation from a vector space $U$ to a vector space $V$ can be represented by a unique matrix.

- This is the foundational concept for computer graphics, as it allows geometric operations (rotation, reflection, projection) to be stored as matrices and applied to objects using simple matrix-vector multiplication.

## Keywords

**Linear Transformation ($T$):**

- A mapping between vector spaces that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication; essentially, it ensures that transforming a sum is the same as summing the transforms.

**Standard Matrix ($[T]$):**

- The matrix representing a transformation from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$ relative to the standard bases; its columns are simply the transformed standard unit vectors ($T(e_i)$).

**Ordered Basis:**

- A specific list of basis vectors (e.g., $A = (a_1, \dots, a_n)$) used to define the coordinates of vectors; the matrix representation of a transformation depends entirely on the choice of these bases.

**Representative Matrix ($T_{A,B}$):**

- The general matrix that represents a linear transformation relative to an ordered basis $A$ for the input space and an ordered basis $B$ for the output space.

## Formulas

**Conditions for Linearity**

- **Formula:** $T(ax_1 + bx_2) = aT(x_1) + bT(x_2)$

- **Meaning:** A function is linear if and only if it preserves linear combinations.

- **Use in graphics:** Verifying that a graphics operation will map straight lines to straight lines (and the origin to the origin).

**Constructing the Standard Matrix**

- **Formula:** $[T] = [\ T(e_1) \mid T(e_2) \mid \dots \mid T(e_n) \ ]$

- **Meaning:** The $i$-th column of the matrix is the result of applying the transformation to the $i$-th standard unit vector.

- **Use in graphics:** Deriving rotation or reflection matrices by determining where the X, Y, and Z axes move.

**General Matrix Representation**

- **Formula:** $y_B = T_{A,B} x_A$

- **Meaning:** The coordinates of the output (in basis $B$) are found by multiplying the representative matrix by the coordinates of the input (in basis $A$).

- **Use in graphics:** Calculating how an object moves relative to a specific camera view or local coordinate system.

**Matrix from Basis Change**

- **Formula:** $T_{A,B} = B^{-1} [T] A$

- **Meaning:** You can compute the representative matrix for complex bases by sandwiching the standard matrix between the basis matrices (and an inverse).

- **Use in graphics:** Converting a physics simulation from World Space to an object's Local Space.

## Practical Use

**Geometric Transformations**

- Operations like rotation, scaling, and reflection are linear transformations; their matrices are built by tracking where the standard basis vectors land (e.g., for rotation, $e_1$ moves to $(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$).

**Differentiation as Matrix Math**

- For vector spaces of polynomials, calculus operations like differentiation ($D$) can be treated as linear transformations and executed by multiplying coordinate vectors by a matrix.

**Projection**

- Mapping a 3D object onto a 2D screen (projection) is a linear transformation that can be represented by a matrix that essentially "drops" a coordinate dimension.
