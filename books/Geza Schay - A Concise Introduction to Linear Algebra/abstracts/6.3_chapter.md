# Chapter 6.3: The Cross Product of Vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter introduces the **cross product**, a vector operation specific to $\mathbb{R}^3$ that produces a new vector orthogonal (perpendicular) to the two input vectors.

- Geometrically, the length of the cross product equals the area of the parallelogram spanned by the vectors, making it a vital tool for finding normal vectors to planes and calculating areas in 3D space.

## Keywords

**Cross Product ($u \times v$):**

- A vector operation in $\mathbb{R}^3$ defined by a specific determinant formula; it results in a vector perpendicular to both $u$ and $v$.

**Right-Handed Triple:**

- The orientation property where the vectors $u$, $v$, and $u \times v$ (in that order) follow the right-hand rule (like the thumb, index, and middle finger).

**Anticommutative:**

- The property that swapping the order of vectors flips the sign of the result: $v \times u = -(u \times v)$.

**Triple Product:**

- The scalar value $u \cdot (v \times w)$, which equals the determinant of the matrix formed by the three vectors and represents the volume of the spanned parallelepiped.

## Formulas

**Cross Product Definition**

- **Formula:** $u \times v = \begin{vmatrix} i & j & k \\ u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\ v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \end{vmatrix}$

- **Meaning:** A mnemonic using a determinant to calculate the vector components: $(u_2v_3 - u_3v_2)i - (u_1v_3 - u_3v_1)j + (u_1v_2 - u_2v_1)k$.

**Geometric Length (Area)**

- **Formula:** $|u \times v| = |u||v|\sin\theta$

- **Meaning:** The magnitude of the cross product is the area of the parallelogram formed by $u$ and $v$.

**Orthogonality**

- **Formula:** $u \cdot (u \times v) = 0$ and $v \cdot (u \times v) = 0$

- **Meaning:** The result is always perpendicular to the input vectors.

**Physics Applications**

- **Coriolis Force:** $F = 2m v \times \omega$
- **Lorentz Force:** $F = q v \times B$

## Practical Use

**Finding Normal Vectors**

- Calculating the cross product of two edge vectors of a polygon (e.g., a triangle) produces a normal vector, which is essential for defining the orientation of planes and surfaces in 3D graphics.

**Area Calculation**

- The area of a triangle in 3D space can be computed as half the length of the cross product of two of its edges ($\frac{1}{2} |AB \times AC|$).

**Physics Simulations**

- Used to calculate rotational forces, such as the Coriolis force in meteorology or magnetic forces on moving charges.
