# Chapter 8.2: Scaled Partial Pivoting

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter addresses the problem of **roundoff errors** in computational linear algebra.

- It explains that small pivots can disastrously magnify errors during Gaussian elimination, leading to incorrect solutions. The solution is **Scaled Partial Pivoting**, a strategy of reordering rows to ensure the largest relative entry is used as the pivot, maintaining numerical stability.

## Keywords

**Roundoff Error:**

- The cumulative error introduced when a computer rounds numbers to a fixed number of digits (e.g., approximating $1/3$ as $0.333$). These small errors can explode if divided by a tiny number.

**Partial Pivoting:**

- The strategy of swapping rows so that the pivot element (the number used to eliminate entries below it) is the largest available number in that column.

**Scaled Partial Pivoting:**

- A refined strategy where rows are swapped based not just on the absolute size of the pivot candidate, but on its size **relative** to the other numbers in its row. This prevents a row with simply large numbers (like $1000x + 1000y$) from falsely appearing to be the best pivot.

**Condition Number:**

- A measure of how sensitive a matrix is to errors. A high condition number means the matrix is "ill-conditioned," and even small errors in input data will result in massive errors in the solution.

## Procedure (The Algorithm)

**Scaled Partial Pivoting Strategy**

1.  **Calculate Scale Factors:** For each row, find the largest absolute value ($s_i$).

2.  **Calculate Ratios:** For every candidate row in the current column, calculate the ratio of the candidate pivot to its row's scale factor ($r_i = |a_{i1}|/s_i$).

3.  **Swap Rows:** Choose the row with the largest ratio $r_i$ to be the pivot row and move it to the top.

4.  **Eliminate:** Perform standard Gaussian elimination.

## Practical Use

**Numerical Stability**

- Without pivoting, computers cannot reliably solve large systems of linear equations. This algorithm is implemented in standard mathematical software (like MATLAB's `lu` function) to ensure answers are accurate.

**Ill-Conditioned Systems**

- Understanding pivoting helps identify systems where the lines/planes are nearly parallel (ill-conditioned). In these cases, even the best algorithms might struggle, warning engineers that their physical model might need redesigning.
