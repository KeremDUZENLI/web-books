# Chapter 2.1: Gaussian Elimination

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter introduces Gaussian elimination, a systematic algorithm for solving systems of linear equations by transforming their augmented matrices into simpler, triangular forms using elementary row operations.

- It is the computational engine for many computer graphics tasks, including solving for geometric intersections (like ray-triangle tests), calculating lighting coefficients, and simulating physical constraints.

## Keywords

**Linear System:**

- A collection of simultaneous linear equations (e.g., $a_1x + a_2y = b$) that need to be satisfied by the same set of variables.

**Augmented Matrix:**

- A compact rectangular array that contains the coefficients of the variables on the left and the constants from the right side of the equations in the last column.

**Elementary Row Operations:**

- The three valid manipulations (swapping rows, multiplying a row by a nonzero scalar, adding a multiple of one row to another) that change the matrix appearance but preserve the solution set.

**Pivot:**

- The first nonzero entry in a row, used as a "lever" to eliminate (turn to zero) all entries directly below it in the same column.

**Forward Elimination:**

- The first phase of the algorithm where row operations are used to create zeros below the pivots, resulting in an "upper triangular" or echelon form.

**Back Substitution:**

- The second phase where the solution is found by solving the last equation first and substituting the known value back up into the previous equations.

## Formulas

**Augmented Matrix Notation**

- **Formula:** $[A | b]$

- **Meaning:** Represents the system of equations where $A$ is the coefficient matrix and $b$ is the column of constants.

- **Use in graphics:** Storing and manipulating systems of linear constraints efficiently in memory.

**Row Operation (Elimination)**

- **Formula:** $R_{new} = R_{old} - c \cdot R_{pivot}$

- **Meaning:** Replaces a row with the difference between itself and a scaled version of the pivot row to create a zero.

- **Use in graphics:** The core computational step in solving matrix transforms or physics systems.

## Practical Use

**Geometric Intersections**

- Solving a system of linear equations to find the exact point where multiple planes or lines intersect in 3D space.

**Curve Fitting**

- Finding the coefficients for a polynomial curve (like a spline) that passes through a specific set of control points.

**Physics Simulations**

- Solving constraints in rigid body dynamics, such as calculating the forces needed to keep a character's feet planted on the ground.
