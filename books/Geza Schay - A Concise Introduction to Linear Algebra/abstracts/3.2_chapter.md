# Chapter 3.2: Subspaces

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter defines a **subspace** as a smaller, self-contained vector space located inside a larger one (like a plane passing through the origin inside 3D space).

- It simplifies the rules for checking vector spaces: instead of testing all eight axioms, you only need to verify that the subset is non-empty and "closed" (operations don't produce results outside the set).

## Keywords

**Subspace:**

- A subset of a vector space that is itself a vector space; it uses the same addition and multiplication rules as the larger space.

**Closure:**

- The requirement that if you add two vectors in the set or multiply one by a scalar, the result stays inside the set.

**Span:**

- The set of all possible linear combinations of a specific list of vectors; the span of any set of vectors is automatically a subspace.

**Null Space (Null(A)):**

- The set of all solution vectors $x$ that satisfy the homogeneous equation $Ax=0$; this set always forms a subspace.

## Formulas

**Subspace Test**

- **Formula:** A subset $U$ is a subspace if:

  1. It is not empty (usually check if $\mathbf{0} \in U$).

  2. If $u, v \in U$, then $u + v \in U$ (Closed under addition).

  3. If $u \in U$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$, then $cu \in U$ (Closed under scalar multiplication).

- **Meaning:** You can't "escape" the set by performing vector operations.

- **Use in graphics:** Verifying that a set of constraints (like movement along a rail) creates a valid geometric space.

**Span (Linear Combinations)**

- **Formula:** $U = \{ \sum s_i u_i \}$

- **Meaning:** The subspace generated by taking all possible mixes of a set of vectors.

- **Use in graphics:** Defining a 2D plane in 3D space using two direction vectors.

**Homogeneous Solution**

- **Formula:** $Ax = 0$

- **Meaning:** The collection of all vectors that are mapped to zero by the matrix $A$.

- **Use in graphics:** Finding the kernel of a transformation (which dimensions are "flattened" or lost).

## Practical Use

**Geometric Primitives**

- Lines and planes passing through the origin are the only proper subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^3$; checking for subspace properties ensures a surface is "flat" and contains the origin.

**Generating Geometry**

- "Spanning" allows you to define infinite geometric shapes (like a polygon's plane) using just a few vectors (vertices).

**Constraint Systems**

- Understanding that solution sets to homogeneous equations ($Ax=0$) form subspaces allows developers to parameterize valid movements in physics engines (degrees of freedom).
