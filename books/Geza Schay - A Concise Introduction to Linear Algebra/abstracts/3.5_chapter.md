# Chapter 3.5: Dimension, Orthogonal Complements

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter formally defines **dimension** as the number of vectors in a basis and establishes that while a space can have many bases, the number of vectors in them is always the same.

- It explores the geometric relationships between the four fundamental subspaces of a matrix (Row, Column, Null, and Left Null spaces), showing how they decompose space into orthogonal (perpendicular) parts.

## Keywords

**Dimension ($dim(X)$):**

- The number of vectors in any basis of a vector space; if the basis is empty (for the zero space), the dimension is 0.

**Rank:**

- The dimension of the column space (and row space) of a matrix; it corresponds to the number of pivots in the echelon form.

**Nullity:**

- The dimension of the null space of a matrix; it represents the number of free variables in the system $Ax=0$.

**Orthogonal Complement ($U^\perp$):**

- The set of all vectors in a space that are orthogonal to every vector in a specific subspace $U$.

**Left Null Space:**

- The set of vectors $y$ such that $y^T A = 0$ (or $A^T y = 0$); it contains the dependencies between the rows of the matrix.

## Formulas

**Rank-Nullity Theorem**

- **Formula:** $rank(A) + nullity(A) = n$ (where $n$ is the number of columns)

- **Meaning:** The total number of variables splits into basic variables (rank) and free variables (nullity).

- **Use in graphics:** Determining degrees of freedom in a system of constraints.

**Orthogonal Decomposition**

- **Formula:** $\mathbb{R}^n = Row(A) + Null(A)$ (Direct Sum)

- **Meaning:** Any vector can be uniquely split into a "row space part" and a "null space part" which are perpendicular to each other.

- **Use in graphics:** Separating a force vector into a component that causes motion and a component that is neutralized by constraints.

**Orthogonality of Fundamental Spaces**

- **Formula:** $Null(A) = Row(A)^\perp$ and $Left\text{-}null(A) = Col(A)^\perp$

- **Meaning:** The null space contains exactly those vectors perpendicular to the rows; the left null space contains those perpendicular to the columns.

- **Use in graphics:** Checking if a vector lies entirely within a specific plane or volume defined by a matrix.

**Dimension of Sum**

- **Formula:** $dim(U+V) = dim(U) + dim(V) - dim(U \cap V)$

- **Meaning:** The size of the union of two spaces equals the sum of their sizes minus the size of their overlap.

- **Use in graphics:** Calculating the complexity of combined geometric shapes.

## Practical Use

**Network Analysis**

- Modeling electrical circuits using incidence matrices; the null space represents currents satisfying Kirchhoff's first law (conservation at nodes), while the left null space relates to voltage drops around loops.

**Decomposing Signals**

- Splitting a vector (signal) into a "relevant" part (in the row space) and a "noise" or "null" part (in the null space) that is filtered out by the transformation.

**Existence of Solutions**

- Determining if a linear system $Ax=b$ has a solution by checking if $b$ is orthogonal to the Left Null Space (since $Col(A) = Left\text{-}null(A)^\perp$).
