# Chapter 2.3: Homogeneous and Inhomogeneous Systems, Gauss-Jordan Elimination

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter defines the matrix-vector product as a linear mapping and distinguishes between homogeneous ($Ax=0$) and inhomogeneous ($Ax=b$) systems.

- It introduces Gauss-Jordan elimination to create "reduced echelon matrices," which allow for reading the general solution of a system directly without back substitution.

## Keywords

**Matrix-Vector Product ($Ax$):**

- A column vector resulting from multiplying matrix $A$ by vector $x$; it represents applying the linear transformation $A$ to the input $x$.

**Homogeneous System:**

- A system where the right-hand side is zero ($Ax=0$); it is always consistent because it includes at least the trivial solution $x=0$.

**Inhomogeneous System:**

- A system where the right-hand side is not zero ($Ax=b$), representing a "shifted" version of the homogeneous solution space.

**Gauss-Jordan Elimination:**

- An extension of Gaussian elimination that reduces a matrix until all pivots are 1 and all other entries in pivot columns are 0 (Reduced Echelon Form).

## Formulas

**Matrix-Vector Product (Component-wise)**

- **Formula:** $(Ax)_i = \sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}x_j$

- **Meaning:** The $i$-th entry of the result is the dot product of the $i$-th row of $A$ and the vector $x$.

- **Use in graphics:** Transforming a vertex position or normal vector.

**Linearity of Transformation**

- **Formula:** $A(x+y) = Ax + Ay$

- **Meaning:** Applying a matrix to a sum of vectors is the same as applying it to each and adding the results.

- **Use in graphics:** Distributing transformations over complex geometry.

**Structure of General Solution**

- **Formula:** $x = x_b + v$

- **Meaning:** The complete solution to $Ax=b$ is a particular solution ($x_b$) plus the general solution ($v$) of the underlying homogeneous system ($Ax=0$).

- **Use in graphics:** Understanding degrees of freedom in constrained systems (like IK).

## Practical Use

**Mapping and Transformations**

- Interpreting a matrix $A$ not just as a table of numbers, but as a function $T(x)$ that maps vectors from one space to another.

**Reduced Echelon Form**

- Using Gauss-Jordan elimination to simplify a matrix so completely that the solution variables are isolated, allowing the answer to be read directly from the entries.

**Network Analysis**

- Solving for unknown quantities in interconnected systems, such as currents in an electrical circuit using Kirchhoff's laws.
