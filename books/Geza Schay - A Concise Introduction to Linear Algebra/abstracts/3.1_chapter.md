# Chapter 3.1: General Vector Spaces

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter generalizes the concept of vectors from Euclidean space ($\mathbb{R}^n$) to any non-empty set of objects (such as matrices or functions) that satisfies eight specific algebraic axioms regarding addition and scalar multiplication.

- It establishes that to form a vector space, a set must be **closed** under these operations; this abstraction allows computer graphics to apply linear algebra to complex data types like polynomial curves ($\mathcal{P}_n$) and transformation matrices ($\mathcal{M}_{m,n}$).

## Keywords

**Vector Space ($V$):**

- A non-empty set of elements (vectors) for which vector addition and scalar multiplication are defined and satisfy eight specific rules (axioms), such as commutativity and the existence of a zero vector.

**Closure:**

- The property that the sum of any two vectors in the set remains in the set ($p+q \in S$), and the product of any vector and scalar remains in the set ($cp \in S$).

**Axioms:**

- The eight required algebraic rules (e.g., Associativity, Distributivity, Existence of Additive Inverse) that a set must verify to be considered a vector space.

**Polynomial Space ($\mathcal{P}_n$):**

- The set of all polynomials of degree $n$ or less (plus the zero polynomial), which forms a vector space because adding two such polynomials or scaling them results in another polynomial of degree $\le n$.

**Function Space ($\mathcal{F}(D)$):**

- A vector space where the "vectors" are real-valued functions defined on a domain $D$, with operations defined by adding or scaling the function values at each point.

## Formulas

**Function Addition**

- **Formula:** $(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$

- **Meaning:** The sum of two functions is defined by adding their outputs at every point $x$.

- **Use in graphics:** Blending two animation curves or mixing audio signals.

**Scalar Multiplication (Functions)**

- **Formula:** $(cf)(x) = c f(x)$

- **Meaning:** Multiplying a function by a scalar scales its output value at every point.

- **Use in graphics:** Adjusting the amplitude of a waveform or the brightness of a texture.

**Zero Vector Property**

- **Formula:** $0p = \mathbf{0}$

- **Meaning:** Multiplying any vector $p$ by the scalar 0 results in the unique zero vector of that space.

- **Use in graphics:** Nullifying a velocity vector or resetting a transformation.

**Additive Inverse**

- **Formula:** $(-c)p = c(-p) = -(cp)$

- **Meaning:** The negative of a scaled vector is the same as scaling the negative vector.

- **Use in graphics:** Reversing the direction of a movement or force.

## Practical Use

**Curve Modeling ($\mathcal{P}_n$)**

- Since polynomials form a vector space, we can add and scale them to create new curves (splines) for defining 3D shapes or motion paths without leaving the mathematical framework.

**Matrix Operations ($\mathcal{M}_{m,n}$)**

- The set of $m \times n$ matrices is a vector space; this means matrices can be added and scaled component-wise, allowing for operations like interpolating between two transformation states.

**Solution Sets**

- The set of solutions to homogeneous differential equations (e.g., $f'(x) + f(x) = 0$) forms a vector space, allowing complex physical simulations to be built from simpler solution "vectors".
