### Exercise 4.4

Let N be the normal vector to a surface at a point P, and let S and T be tangent vectors at the point P such that $S \times T = N$. Given an invertible $3 \times 3$ matrix M, show that:
$$(MS) \times (MT) = (\det M)(M^{-1})^T (S \times T)$$
supporting the fact that normals are correctly transformed by the inverse transpose of the matrix M.

*[Hint: Use Equation (2.25) to write the cross product $(MS) \times (MT)$ as a matrix multiplication, find a matrix G, and use Equation (3.65).]*
