### Exercise 5.7

Suppose that the third row of the infinite projection matrix given by Equation (5.53) is modified so that the view frustum has the oblique near plane $C = \langle 1, 0, -1, -1 \rangle$. Show that the optimal far plane given by Equations (5.65) and (5.66) is parallel to the right frustum plane.
