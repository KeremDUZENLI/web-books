### Answer 5.7

*Note: This exercise relies on the context of Lengyel's specific derivation for oblique frustum clipping.*

Given the oblique near plane $C = \langle 1, 0, -1, -1 \rangle$.
In clip space, a point $P$ is on this plane if $C \cdot P = 0$.
$$x - z - w = 0$$
For a standard projection where $w = -z_{eye}$, and assuming a horizontal FOV of 90 degrees (where the right plane is $x + z = 0$ in view space, or $x_{clip} - w_{clip} = 0$?):

Let's look at the "Optimal Far Plane". The modification of the projection matrix $M$ by the oblique plane $C$ effectively re-maps the $z$-coordinate.
The standard property proven in the text (and papers on this technique) is that the projection of the new near plane $C$ forces the far plane of the frustum to be degenerate or parallel to one of the side planes to maximize depth precision.

Specifically, for $C = \langle 1, 0, -1, -1 \rangle$:
This vector corresponds to the **Right Frustum Plane** in a standard 90-degree FOV setup (where $x=z$ is the right edge).
If the near plane is set exactly to the right frustum plane, the view volume essentially collapses or becomes parallel.
The exercise asks to show that the optimal far plane is parallel to the right frustum plane, which follows from the fact that the projection matrix modification maps the far plane to the plane at infinity in the direction of the camera's new near-plane orientation.

*(Complete derivation requires the specific definitions of Equations 5.53, 5.65, and 5.66 which define the infinite projection matrix $M_{inf}$ and the optimal far plane vector $F$. Analytically, one shows $F \cdot R = 0$ or $F \times R = 0$ depending on definition).*
