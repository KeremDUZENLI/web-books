### Exercise 10.2

Write a program that renders a stencil shadow for a triangle mesh illuminated by a single point light source. Assume that the triangle mesh is specified such that each of n triangles indexes three entries in an array of m vertices. The program should precalculate an edge list, determine the edges belonging to the model's silhouette with respect to the light source, and render the extruded silhouette edges using the stencil buffer operations described in Section 10.3.6.
