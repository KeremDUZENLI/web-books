### Exercise 15.1

Suppose that the fluid surface displacement of each vertex in a triangle mesh is evaluated 20 times per second. If the distance between neighboring vertices is 0.1 m and the viscous damping constant is $\mu=1 s^{-1}$, what is the maximum wave speed for which Equation (15.25) is numerically stable?
