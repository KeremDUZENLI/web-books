### Exercise 9.3

Write a program that applies a decal to a surface. Assume that the decal is described by its center P, a normal direction N, a tangent direction T, its width w, and its height h. The program should construct a decal object by clipping an arbitrary triangle mesh to the planes bounding the decal and should then calculate texture coordinates for each vertex in the decal object.
