### Exercise 9.4

Implement a particle system for which each particle is rendered as a textured quad centered at the particle's position. Each particle should be described by its position P in world space, its radius r, and an orientation angle $\alpha$. The vertices of the quad should be calculated in the vertex shader so that the quad always faces the camera.
