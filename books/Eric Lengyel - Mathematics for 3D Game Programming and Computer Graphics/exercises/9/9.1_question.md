### Exercise 9.1

Suppose that the distance to the near plane is $n=1$, and the distance to the far plane is $f=100$ for a particular view frustum. Calculate by what value the (3,3) entry of the projection matrix should be multiplied in order to offset a model centered at a depth of $z=-20$ toward the camera by a distance of 0.2.
