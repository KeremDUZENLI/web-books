### Exercise 6.4

Let $P_0$, $P_1$, and $P_2$ be the three vertices of the triangle T. Show that each of the barycentric coordinates $w_i$ of a point P lying inside the triangle is given by the ratio of the area of the subtriangle $U_i$ formed using P and the two vertices $P_{i+1 (\text{mod } 3)}$ and $P_{i+2 (\text{mod } 3)}$ to the area of the triangle T.
