### Answer 6.5

Let $P$ have barycentric coordinates $(w_0, w_1, w_2)$ in the plane of the triangle.
We determine coordinates by solving the system derived from Eq 6.59 involving dot products with edge vectors $Q_1, Q_2$.

**1. Point Q:**
Let $Q = P + rN$, where $N$ is the triangle normal.
$N$ is orthogonal to all edge vectors in the plane ($N \cdot Q_1 = 0$, $N \cdot Q_2 = 0$).

**2. Relative Vector:**
$R_Q = Q - P_0 = (P + rN) - P_0 = (P - P_0) + rN = R_P + rN$.

**3. Update Dot Products (RHS of Eq 6.59):**
$$R_Q \cdot Q_1 = (R_P + rN) \cdot Q_1 = R_P \cdot Q_1 + r(N \cdot Q_1) = R_P \cdot Q_1 + 0$$
$$R_Q \cdot Q_2 = (R_P + rN) \cdot Q_2 = R_P \cdot Q_2 + r(N \cdot Q_2) = R_P \cdot Q_2 + 0$$

**4. Conclusion:**
Since the dot products $R \cdot Q_1$ and $R \cdot Q_2$ are unchanged, and the matrix of edge dot products depends only on the triangle vertices, the calculated weights $w_1$ and $w_2$ (and thus $w_0$) remain identical for $Q$ and $P$.
