### Exercise 6.8

The critical angle at the interface between two media is the smallest angle of incidence at which total internal reflection occurs. Determine the critical angle for a beam of light traveling upward through water toward the surface where it meets the air. The index of refraction of water is 1.33, and the index of refraction of air is 1.00.
