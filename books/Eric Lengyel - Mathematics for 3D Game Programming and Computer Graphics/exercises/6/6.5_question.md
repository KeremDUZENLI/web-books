### Exercise 6.5

Let $w_1$, $w_2$, and $w_3$ be the barycentric coordinates of a point P with respect to a triangle whose vertices are $P_0$, $P_1$, and $P_2$. Let N be the direction normal to the triangle. Show that the barycentric coordinates of the point $P + rN$ are the same as those of the point P for any scalar r.
