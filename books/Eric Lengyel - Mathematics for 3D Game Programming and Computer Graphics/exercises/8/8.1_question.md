### Exercise 8.1

Given two spheres $S_1$ and $S_2$ centered at the points $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, and having radii $r_1$ and $r_2$, respectively, determine the center Q and radius r of the smallest single sphere that encloses both $S_1$ and $S_2$. Account for the cases that the two spheres are disjoint, that the two spheres intersect, and that one of the spheres encloses the other.
