### Exercise 8.3

Determine the effective radius $r_{eff}$ of a box whose edges are described by the vectors $R=\langle 2,0,1 \rangle$, $S=\langle 1,0,-2 \rangle$ and $T=\langle 0,1,0 \rangle$ with respect to a plane having unit normal direction $N=\langle \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}, -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \rangle$.
