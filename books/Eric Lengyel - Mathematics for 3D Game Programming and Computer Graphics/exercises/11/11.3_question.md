### Exercise 11.3

(a) Show that the Kochanek-Bartels blending functions sum to 1.
(b) Under what conditions does the tangent direction $T_{i,2}$ for the curve interpolating $P_i$ and $P_{i+1}$ match the tangent direction $T_{i+1,1}$ for the curve interpolating $P_{i+1}$ and $P_{i+2}$?
(c) Find the basis matrix $M_{KB}$ corresponding to the curve interpolating $P_i$ and $P_{i+1}$ that describes the Kochanek-Bartels blending functions. Assume that the geometry matrix is $G_{KB} = \begin{bmatrix} P_{i-1} & P_i & P_{i+1} & P_{i+2} \end{bmatrix}^T$.
