### Exercise 11.2

Show that the Catmull-Rom spline with $\tau = 1/2$ is the only Cardinal spline for which $2Q(t) + (-t) = Q(t) + Q(-t)$ is constant?
*Note: The question text in the source seems slightly malformed or refers to a specific property. Based on context, it likely asks about symmetry or a specific property of the basis functions. I will transcribe the prompt as physically legible in the source if ambiguous, or standard interpretation: "Show that... is the only Cardinal spline..."*
*(Self-Correction based on typical spline math: Cardinal splines with $\tau=0.5$ are Catmull-Rom. The question likely asks to show it reduces to the Catmull-Rom basis matrix derived in text.)*

**Correction based on source text:**
The source text asks:
"Show that the Catmull-Rom spline with $\tau = 1/2$ is the only Cardinal spline for which..."
(The text cuts off or refers to "reduce to the Catmull-Rom spline?" in previous snippet. Let's look at the specific snippet provided in `11.pdf` metadata if available, otherwise reconstruct standard exercise.)

*Re-reading snippet:* "duce to the Catmull-Rom spline?"
This implies the question is: **Show that the Cardinal spline matrix reduces to the Catmull-Rom spline matrix when $\tau = 1/2$.**
