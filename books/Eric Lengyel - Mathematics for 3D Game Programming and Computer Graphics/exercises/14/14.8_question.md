### Exercise 14.8

Suppose that a box of uniform density having mass m is resting on the ground where the coefficient of static friction is $\mu_S$ (see Figure 14.15). The box has a square base of length and width d, and the box's height is h. Determine the minimum height z at which a force $F < \mu_S mg$ applied directly to the horizontal center of a side of the box would cause the box to begin toppling over. [Hint. Equate the torques induced by the pull of gravity on the center of mass and the force F about the bottom edge on the side opposite that where the force is applied.]
