### Exercise 14.7

A spherical ball of mass m and radius R is placed on an incline that forms an angle $\theta$ with the ground (see Figure 14.14). The coefficient of static friction at the surface is $\mu_S$. If the ball rolls down the incline under the influence of gravity without slipping, determine its acceleration a. [Hint. Two forces are acting on the ball, gravity and the frictional force, whose sum is equal to ma. The frictional force also exerts torque on the ball, inducing an angular acceleration $\alpha$. Use the fact that $a = R\alpha$ as the ball rolls down the incline.]
