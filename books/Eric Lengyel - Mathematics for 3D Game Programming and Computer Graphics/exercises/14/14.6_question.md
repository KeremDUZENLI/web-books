### Exercise 14.6

Suppose that an object of mass m is hanging from a rope of negligible mass that is wrapped around a cylindrical spool many times (see Figure 14.13). If the cylinder has mass M and radius R, determine at what rate a the object accelerates downward under the influence of gravity. Assume that the rope does not slip as it unwinds from the spool. [Hint. As gravity pulls on the object, it creates a tension T in the rope that is counteracted by the cylinder, so the force equation is $ma = mg - T$. The tension T exerts a torque on the cylinder that induces an angular acceleration $\alpha$. Use the fact that $a = R\alpha$.]
