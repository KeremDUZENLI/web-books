### Exercise 14.5

Calculate the inertia tensor of an axis-aligned capsule about its center of mass. A capsule is a solid cylinder with height h (in the z direction) and semiaxis lengths a and b (along the x and y axes, respectively) that has two identical dome-shaped endcaps with semiaxis lengths a, b, and c, as shown in Figure 14.12. Let m be the total mass of the capsule and assume a uniform density $\rho$. [Hint. Combine the inertia tensors for a cylinder and two domes in the appropriate way.]
