### Exercise 14.2

Suppose that a block of mass m is resting on the surface of a rotating disk at a distance r from the axis of rotation. If the coefficient of static friction at the surface is $\mu_S$, determine the angular velocity at which the disk must rotate to cause the block to begin sliding outward.
