### Exercise 13.5

Suppose a projectile is launched from the origin and travels toward a point P in the x-z plane as shown in Figure 13.6. Assuming an acceleration of gravity $g = \langle 0, 0, -g \rangle$, at what initial velocity $v_0$ would the projectile have to be launched so that it strikes the point P under the constraint that its path attains a maximum vertical difference h with the straight line connecting the origin and the point P?
