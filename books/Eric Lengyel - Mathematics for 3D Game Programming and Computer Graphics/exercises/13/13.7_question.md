### Exercise 13.7

An object of mass M is hanging from a rope that runs over a frictionless pulley and connects to another object of mass m lying on an inclined plane that forms an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal (see Figure 13.7). The coefficient of kinetic friction on the incline is $\mu_K$. Assuming that M is much larger than m, determine the downward acceleration a of the hanging object. [Hint. Both masses are being accelerated, so the sum of the forces acting on the system should be set equal to $(M+m)a$.]
