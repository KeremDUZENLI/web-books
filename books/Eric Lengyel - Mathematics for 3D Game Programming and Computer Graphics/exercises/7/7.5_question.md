### Exercise 7.5

Write a program that calculates vertex normals and vertex tangents for an arbitrary triangle mesh. Assume that the triangle mesh is specified such that each of n triangles indexes three entries in an array of m vertices. Each entry in the vertex array contains the position of the vertex and two-dimensional texture-mapping coordinates.
