### Exercise 7.4

Let L be the normalized direction to the light source and V be the normalized direction to the viewer at a surface point where the unit normal vector is N. Show that
$$(N \cdot H)^m = \left[\frac{(N \cdot L + N \cdot V)^2}{2(L \cdot V + 1)}\right]^{m/2}$$
where H is the halfway vector defined by Equation (7.9), and m is an arbitrary specular exponent.
