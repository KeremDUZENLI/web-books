### Exercise 7.2

A spot light source positioned 10 meters above the origin at the point $P = \langle 0, 0, 10 \rangle$ and radiating energy in the direction $R = \langle 0, 0, -1 \rangle$ is configured so that no distance attenuation takes place by setting $k_c = 1$ and $k_l = k_q = 0$. If the color of the light is white $(\mathcal{C}_0 = (1, 1, 1))$ and the spot exponent is 8, then what is the radius of the circle lying in the x-y plane where the intensity of the light is 50 percent gray $(\mathcal{C} = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2))$?
