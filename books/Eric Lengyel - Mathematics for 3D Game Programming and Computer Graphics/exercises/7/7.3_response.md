### Answer 7.3

The term $N \cdot L < 0$ indicates that the light source is behind the plane defined by the surface normal (the "back" side of the surface).

However, the halfway vector $H$ is the normalized bisector of the light vector $L$ and the view vector $V$. Even if $L$ is slightly below the horizon of the surface ($N \cdot L < 0$), if the viewer $V$ is sufficiently above the horizon, the resulting bisector $H$ may still point above the surface ($N \cdot H > 0$).

Without the clamp $(N \cdot L > 0)$, the lighting formula would generate a specular highlight in this situation. This is physically incorrect for opaque objects because the surface itself blocks the light from reaching that point (self-shadowing). Therefore, the term $(N \cdot L > 0)$ is required to ensure specular highlights are only calculated when the light actually strikes the front face of the surface.
