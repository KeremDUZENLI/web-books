### Answer 3.7

Let D be the diagonal matrix with entries $d_i$.
$$D = \text{diag}(d_1, d_2, ..., d_n)$$

We seek a matrix $D^{-1}$ such that $D D^{-1} = I$.
Let $B$ be a candidate diagonal matrix with entries $b_i = 1/d_i$.
$$B = \text{diag}(\frac{1}{d_1}, \frac{1}{d_2}, ..., \frac{1}{d_n})$$

Compute the product $(DB)_{ij}$:
$$(DB)_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^n D_{ik} B_{kj}$$
Since D and B are diagonal, $D_{ik} = 0$ if $i \neq k$ and $B_{kj} = 0$ if $k \neq j$.
The sum is nonzero only when $i = k = j$.

For diagonal entries ($i=j$):
$$(DB)_{ii} = D_{ii} B_{ii} = d_i (\frac{1}{d_i}) = 1$$

For off-diagonal entries ($i \neq j$):
$$(DB)_{ij} = 0$$

Thus, $DB = I$. Since matrix multiplication is commutative for diagonal matrices, $BD = I$ as well.
Therefore, $B$ is the inverse of $D$.
