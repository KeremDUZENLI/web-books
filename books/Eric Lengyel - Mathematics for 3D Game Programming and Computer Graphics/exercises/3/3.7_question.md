### Exercise 3.7

Let D be an $n \times n$ diagonal matrix whose main diagonal entries are $d_1, d_2, ..., d_n$ as shown below. Show that the inverse of D is also a diagonal matrix, and that its main diagonal entries are given by $1/d_1, 1/d_2, ..., 1/d_n$.

$D = \begin{bmatrix} d_1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & d_2 & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \cdots & d_n \end{bmatrix}$
