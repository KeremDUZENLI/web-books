### Answer 3.5

**Proof:**

1.  Let the rows of M be a set of linearly independent vectors. This implies that M is invertible (Theorem 3.15).
2.  Let E be an elementary matrix. By definition, elementary matrices are invertible (determinant is non-zero: 1, -1, or $a \neq 0$).
3.  Consider the product $M' = EM$.
4.  Since M is invertible and E is invertible, their product $M'$ is also invertible (Theorem 3.11: $(EM)^{-1} = M^{-1}E^{-1}$).
5.  Since $M'$ is invertible, its rows must form a linearly independent set (Theorem 3.15).

Therefore, the rows of EM form a linearly independent set.
