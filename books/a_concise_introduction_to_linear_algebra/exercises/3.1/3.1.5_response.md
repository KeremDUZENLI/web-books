### Answer 3.1.5

**No, this is not a vector space.**

**Reason (Zero Vector):**
The zero function $f(x) = 0$ does not satisfy the equation:
$f'' + 2f = 0 + 0 = 0 \neq 1$.
Since the zero vector is missing, it cannot be a vector space.


*Geometric Note:* This is like a line that doesn't pass through the origin.
