### Answer 3.1.15

**a. MATLAB Checks:**
`plq` implies boolean addition (OR) or perhaps XOR. `c&p` implies AND.
If using standard logic:
$1 + 1 = 1$ (OR) or $0$ (XOR).
If the set is quintuples of 0s and 1s, we are working in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ (integers mod 2) if it's XOR.
If it's OR, inverses fail ($1 + x = 0$ has no solution).

**b. Vector Space Analysis:**
If Addition = `OR` ($1+1=1$):
**Not a vector space.** The additive inverse axiom fails. The zero vector is $(0,0,0,0,0)$.
Take $\mathbf{p} = (1,0,0,0,0)$. We need $\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}$.
$(1 \text{ OR } x) = 0$. This is impossible; once a bit is 1, `OR` keeps it 1.

If Addition = `XOR` ($1+1=0$):
**Yes, it is a vector space** over the field of scalars $\{0, 1\}$. This is $\mathbb{Z}_2^5$.

**c. Restricted Scalars:**
Yes, if scalars are $\{0, 1\}$ and addition is XOR, it is a valid vector space over a finite field.
