### Exercise 3.1.16

Let $V$ denote the set of all ordered quintuples of real numbers and define addition of vectors by the MATLAB command `max(p,q)` and multiplication by scalars by componentwise multiplication as in $\mathbb{R}^5$.

a. Generate such vectors by the command `round(10*rand(1,5)-5);` and use MATLAB to check whether each of the vector space axioms is satisfied for those vectors and selected scalars.

b. If you think this is a vector space, prove it. If not, explain why.
