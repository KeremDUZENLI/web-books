**Yes, this is a vector space.**

The set of **all** polynomials $\mathcal{P}$ satisfies all axioms.
1.  Adding two polynomials gives a polynomial.
2.  Multiplying a polynomial by a scalar gives a polynomial.
3.  Standard arithmetic properties (commutativity, associativity, distributive laws) hold for polynomials.
