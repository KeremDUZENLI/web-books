### Answer 3.1.2

**Yes, this is a vector space.**

This is a **subspace** of $\mathbb{R}^2$ (a line through the origin).
1.  **Closure under addition:**
    Let $\mathbf{u} = (x_1, y_1)$ such that $2x_1 + 3y_1 = 0$.
    Let $\mathbf{v} = (x_2, y_2)$ such that $2x_2 + 3y_2 = 0$.
    Check $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = (x_1+x_2, y_1+y_2)$:
    $2(x_1+x_2) + 3(y_1+y_2) = (2x_1+3y_1) + (2x_2+3y_2) = 0 + 0 = 0$.
    It stays in the set.
2.  **Closure under scalar multiplication:**
    Check $c\mathbf{u} = (cx_1, cy_1)$:
    $2(cx_1) + 3(cy_1) = c(2x_1 + 3y_1) = c(0) = 0$.
    It stays in the set.
3.  **Zero vector:** $(0,0)$ satisfies $2(0) + 3(0) = 0$.

Since it is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^2$ closed under linear combinations, it is a vector space.
