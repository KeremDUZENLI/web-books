### Exercise 3.1.14

Show that we could define vector spaces by just seven axioms instead of eight if we replace Axioms 3 and 4 by the single axiom:

**3'.** There is a vector $\mathbf{0}$ such that $0\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{0}$ holds for all vectors $\mathbf{p}$.

In other words, prove that if we define the zero vector by Axiom 3' instead of Axiom 3, then this axiom in conjunction with the other axioms implies both the additive property of the zero vector expressed in Axiom 3 and the existence of additive inverses expressed in Axiom 4, with $(-1)\mathbf{p}$ in the role of $-\mathbf{p}$.
