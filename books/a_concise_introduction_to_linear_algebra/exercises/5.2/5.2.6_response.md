### Answer 5.2.6

**Given:** $P, Q$ are orthogonal ($P^T P = I, Q^T Q = I$).

**Check $PQ$:**
We calculate $(PQ)^T (PQ)$.
Using the property $(AB)^T = B^T A^T$:
$$ (PQ)^T (PQ) = (Q^T P^T) (P Q) $$
By associativity:
$$ = Q^T (P^T P) Q $$
Since $P^T P = I$:
$$ = Q^T I Q = Q^T Q $$
Since $Q^T Q = I$:
$$ = I $$
Since $(PQ)^T (PQ) = I$, the matrix $PQ$ is orthogonal.
