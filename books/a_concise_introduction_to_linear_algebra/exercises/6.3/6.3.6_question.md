### Exercise 6.3.6

- Let $\mathbf{n}_{1}, \mathbf{n}_{2}, \mathbf{n}_{3}, \mathbf{n}_{4}$ denote the outward pointing area vectors of a tetrahedron. Prove that their sum equals $\mathbf{0}$.

(Hint: Let $\mathbf{a}_{1},...,\mathbf{a}_{6}$ denote the edge vectors, write each area vector as a cross product of these, and apply the appropriate properties from Theorem 6.3.1 to the sum.)
