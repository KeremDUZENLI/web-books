### Answer 2.1.15

**Concept:**
Three planes have the same line of intersection if the system of equations has infinitely many solutions with 1 degree of freedom (1 free variable), and the system is consistent.

**Matrix from Ex 2.1.5:**
$$ \left[ \begin{array}{ccc|c} 1 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\ -2 & 3 & -1 & 0 \\ -6 & 6 & 0 & 0 \end{array} \right] $$
We found the solution $\mathbf{x} = t(1, 1, 1)$.
This is a line through the origin.
All three planes pass through this line.
Taking any pair of equations (rows), the solution space is still this line (or a plane containing this line, but since they are distinct non-parallel planes, the intersection of any pair is a line).
Since the third plane passes through the intersection line of the first two (proven by the consistency and the 1-dim solution space), they all share the same line.
