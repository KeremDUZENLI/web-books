### Answer 2.1.14

**The Error:**
In the step $r_1 \leftarrow r_1$, no change happened to $r_1$.
However, the row echelon form was reached with $x_1, x_2, x_3$ as pivot candidates.
Specifically, in the final matrix:
$$ \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 \\ 0 & -4 & 1 & 4 & 9 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} $$
* Row 1 pivot is column 1 ($x_1$).
* Row 2 pivot is column 2 ($x_2$).
* Row 3 is all zeros.

**The issue in the proposed solution:**
The solver arbitrarily set $x_3 = s$ and $x_4 = t$.
Looking at Row 2: $-4x_2 + x_3 + 4x_4 + 9x_5 = 9$.
Usually, we identify pivots.
Here pivots are at col 1 and col 2.
Free variables are col 3 ($x_3$), col 4 ($x_4$), and col 5 ($x_5$).
The solver completely ignored $x_5$ in the parameterization or implicitly assumed $x_5=0$ without justification.
Wait, let's look at the original matrix in the problem statement. It's $3 \times 5$.
Variables are $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5$.
The solver treated the last column (col 5) as the RHS of a $3 \times 4$ system, but the text implies it's a homogeneous system or the variables/constants are misidentified.
*Correction:* If this is a $3 \times 5$ augmented matrix representing 3 equations and 4 variables, the last column is constants.
Pivot cols: 1 and 2.
Free vars: $x_3, x_4$.
Row 3 zeros means $0=0$. Consistent.
Equation 2: $-4x_2 + x_3 + 4x_4 = 9$.
$x_2 = (9 - s - 4t)/(-4)$.
This matches the solver's algebra.

**So what is really wrong?**
Look at the operation $r_3 \leftarrow r_3 - 2r_2$ in the second step.
Row 3 was $(6, -8, -3, -2, 1)$.
Row 2 was $(3, -6, -1, 1, 5)$.
$6 - 2(3) = 0$.
$-8 - 2(-6) = -8 + 12 = 4$. (Solver wrote 4. Correct).
$-3 - 2(-1) = -1$. (Solver wrote -1. Correct).
$-2 - 2(1) = -4$. (Solver wrote -4. Correct).
$1 - 2(5) = -9$. (Solver wrote -9. Correct).

Actually, the error is in the **Choice of Free Variables** vs **Pivot Variables**.
The solver chose $x_3, x_4$ as free.
Pivots were $x_1, x_2$.
This is actually a **valid** choice for this specific matrix structure.

**The Real Error:**
In the problem statement 2.1.13, the solution found was $x_5 = 1$.
Here, the solver treats the 5th column as part of the coefficient matrix (implied by "solving Exercise 2.1.13" but treating it as a homogeneous system or misinterpreting the matrix dimensions?).
If the matrix shown is the **augmented** matrix, the variables are $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$.
If so, $x_3=s, x_4=t$ is correct.
However, compare the row reduction to 2.1.13 solution.
In 2.1.13, the last row became $[0, 0, 0, 0, -1]$. This implies inconsistency ($0 = -1$) if the last col is RHS.
The "solver" here got a row of zeros.
Let's re-check the reduction arithmetic.
Start:
R1: $3, -6, -1, 1, 5$
R2: $-1, 2, 2, 3, 3$
R3: $6, -8, -3, -2, 1$
Swap R1/R2:
R1: $-1, 2, 2, 3, 3$
R2: $3, -6, -1, 1, 5$
R3: $6, -8, -3, -2, 1$
Op: $R_2 \leftarrow R_2 + 3R_1$: $3 + 3(-1) = 0$; $-6 + 3(2) = 0$; $-1 + 3(2) = 5$.
**Solver wrote**: $R_2$ becomes $(0, -4, 1, 4, 9)$?
No! $-6 + 3(2) = 0$. The solver calculated $-6 + 2 = -4$?
**Arithmetic Error in Step 2.** The term $-6$ in row 2 is cancelled by $3 \times 2$ in row 1. The entry $(2,2)$ should be 0, not $-4$. The pivot is lost.
