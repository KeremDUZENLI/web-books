### Answer 3.5.21

**Proof:**
Let $B_U = \{u_1, \dots, u_k\}$ be basis for $U$.
Let $B_V = \{v_1, \dots, v_m\}$ be basis for $V$.
Consider $B = B_U \cup B_V$.
Since $U+V$ is spanned by $U \cup V$, $B$ spans $U+V$.
Are they independent?
$\sum c_i u_i + \sum d_j v_j = 0 \implies \sum c_i u_i = - \sum d_j v_j$.
LHS $\in U$. RHS $\in V$.
Common vector must be in $U \cap V$.
Since $U \cap V = \{0\}$, both sides are 0.
$\sum c_i u_i = 0 \implies c_i = 0$ (Basis $U$).
$\sum d_j v_j = 0 \implies d_j = 0$ (Basis $V$).
Thus $B$ is a basis. Size is $k+m = dim(U) + dim(V)$.
