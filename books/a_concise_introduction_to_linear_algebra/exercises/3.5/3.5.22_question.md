### Exercise 3.5.22

* Show that for any finite-dimensional subspaces $U$ and $V$ of a vector space $X$ the sum $U + V$ is direct if and only if every $x \in U + V$ can be decomposed uniquely into a sum of a vector $u$ from $U$ and a vector $v$ from $V$, that is, $x = u + v$, with $u$ and $v$ uniquely determined by $x$.
