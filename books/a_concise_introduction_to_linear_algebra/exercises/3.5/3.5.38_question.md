### Exercise 3.5.38

* Prove the following generalization of the algorithm of Exercise 3.5.36 to invert a matrix:

Let $A$ be any real, nonsingular $n \times n$ matrix. Consider the block matrix $\begin{bmatrix} A & I \\ -I & O \end{bmatrix}$ where $I$ is the unit matrix of order $n$ and $O$ is the $n \times n$ zero matrix. Row-reduce this block matrix, without exchanging or multiplying any of the last $n$ rows in the process, to a form $\begin{bmatrix} U & L \\ O & M \end{bmatrix}$ in which $U$ is upper triangular. Then $M = A^{-1}$.
