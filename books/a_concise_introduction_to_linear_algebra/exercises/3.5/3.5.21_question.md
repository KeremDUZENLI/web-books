### Exercise 3.5.21

* For any subspaces $U$ and $V$ of a vector space $X$ we call $U + V$ a direct sum if $U \cap V = \{0\}$, and denote it in that case by $U \oplus V$. Show that for any finite-dimensional subspaces with $U \cap V = \{0\}$ we have $dim(U \oplus V) = dim(U) + dim(V)$. (Hint: Consider a basis for each subspace.)
