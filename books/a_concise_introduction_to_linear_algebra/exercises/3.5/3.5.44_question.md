### Exercise 3.5.44

Let `A = magic(4)`.

a. Use `rref` as explained above to find a basis for $Left-null(A)$ and for $Null(A)$. Extract and transpose the appropriate submatrix in each case to obtain two matrices $B$ and $C$ whose columns form the bases.

b. Use `N = null(A)` and `L = null(A')` to obtain two different bases, and show that they span the same subspaces as $B$ and $C$, respectively.

c. Use `rref` as in Exercise 3.4.15 to compute bases for $Row(A)$ and $Col(A)$.

d. Decompose $x = (1, 2, 3, 4)^T$ into a sum of an $x_0 \in Null(A)$ and an $x_R \in Row(A)$.

e. Decompose $x$ into a sum of an $x_L \in Left-null(A)$ and an $x_C \in Col(A)$.
