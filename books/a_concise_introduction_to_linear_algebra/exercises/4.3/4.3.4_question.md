### Exercise 4.3.4

Find the matrix that rotates an arbitrary vector $\mathbf{p}$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$ into the $z$-axis

a. by first rotating it about the $z$-axis into the $xz$-plane and then about the $y$-axis into the $z$-axis, and

b. by first rotating it about the $z$-axis into the $yz$-plane and then about the $x$-axis into the $z$-axis.
