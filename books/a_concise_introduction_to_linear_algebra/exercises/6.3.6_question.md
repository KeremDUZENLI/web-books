### Exercise 6.3.6

Let $\mathbf{n}_1, \mathbf{n}_2, \mathbf{n}_3, \mathbf{n}_4$ denote the outward pointing area vectors of a tetrahedron.

Prove that their sum equals 0.

(Hint: Let $\mathbf{a}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{a}_6$ denote the edge vectors, write each area vector as a cross product of these, and apply the appropriate properties from Theorem 6.3.1 to the sum.)
