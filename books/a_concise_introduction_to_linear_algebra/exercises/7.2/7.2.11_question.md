### Exercise 7.2.11

In biology the following type of simplified models for predator-prey populations are sometimes considered: Assume that in a certain area the number of animals of a certain predator species is $x_{1}(k)$ in year $k$, and the number of its prey is $x_{2}(k)$. Furthermore, the number of predators in the next year decreases in proportion to $x_{1}(k)$ and increases in proportion to the available food $x_{2}(k)$, while the number of prey animals decreases in proportion to the number of predators and increases in proportion to their own numbers. Thus, if we ignore other factors, we may for instance assume

$$
x_{1}(k+1)=0.8x_{1}(k)+0.4x_{2}(k)
$$

and

$$
x_{2}(k+1)=-0.8x_{1}(k)+2.0x_{2}(k).
$$

Solve these equations for all $k$, assuming also that initially there were 1000 animals of each kind. What happens as $k\rightarrow\infty$?
