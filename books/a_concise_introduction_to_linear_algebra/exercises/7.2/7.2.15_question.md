### Exercise 7.2.15

If $A$ is an $m\times r$ matrix and has rank $r$, then $AA^{T}$ is an $m\times m$ symmetric matrix of rank $r$. (Why?)

a. Use the fact above to generate random symmetric matrices of ranks 1, 2, and 3 for $m=4,5,6$.

b. Use `eig` to find the eigenvalues of each matrix generated in Part a and note the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0.

c. Make a conjecture about the dependence of the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 on $m$ and $r$, and prove it.
