### Answer 2.2.7

**Proof:**

1.  **Rank Definition:** The rank of a matrix is the number of pivots in its echelon form.
2.  **Inconsistent Case:** A system is inconsistent if and only if, during Gaussian elimination, we obtain a row of the form $[0 \ 0 \ \dots \ 0 \mid p]$ where $p \neq 0$.
    * In this case, the augmented matrix $[A|\mathbf{b}]$ has a pivot in the last column (the $\mathbf{b}$ column).
    * This pivot adds to the count of pivots in $A$.
    * Thus, Rank$([A|\mathbf{b}]) = \text{Rank}(A) + 1$.
3.  **Consistent Case:** A system is consistent if and only if there is **no** pivot in the augmented column.
    * In this case, all pivots found in $[A|\mathbf{b}]$ are located within the columns corresponding to $A$.
    * Thus, the number of pivots in $[A|\mathbf{b}]$ is exactly the same as the number of pivots in $A$.
    * Rank$([A|\mathbf{b}]) = \text{Rank}(A)$.

**Conclusion:**
$A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ is consistent $\iff \text{Rank}(A) = \text{Rank}([A|\mathbf{b}])$.
