### Exercise 2.2.6

Find conditions on a general vector $\mathbf{b}$ that would make the equation $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ consistent for the given matrix $A$:

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & -1 \\
-2 & 3 & -1 \\
3 & -3 & 0 \\
2 & 0 & -2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

(Hint: Reduce the augmented matrix using undetermined components $b_{i}$ of $\mathbf{b}$, until the $A$ in it is changed to echelon form, and set $c_{r+1}=c_{r+2}=\cdots=0.$)
