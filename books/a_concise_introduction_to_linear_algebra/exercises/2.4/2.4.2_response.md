### Answer 2.4.2

**Proof:**

The definition of the product of a scalar $c$ and a matrix $A$ states that every entry of the resulting matrix is obtained by multiplying the corresponding entry of $A$ by $c$.

Let $B = cA$.
By definition, the entry in the $i$-th row and $k$-th column of $B$, denoted $(B)_{ik}$ or $(cA)_{ik}$, is given by:
$$ (cA)_{ik} = c \cdot a_{ik} $$
This holds for all valid indices $i$ and $k$.
