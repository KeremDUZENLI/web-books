### Answer 1.2.19

**Defined Product:** $\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{q} = 2 p_1 q_1 + p_2 q_2$.

**Checking Properties:**
1.  **Symmetry:** $2 p_1 q_1 + p_2 q_2 = 2 q_1 p_1 + q_2 p_2$. (Yes, standard mult is commutative).
2.  **Linearity:** e.g., $(c\mathbf{p}) \cdot \mathbf{q} = 2(cp_1)q_1 + (cp_2)q_2 = c(2p_1q_1 + p_2q_2)$. (Yes).
3.  **Positivity:** $\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{p} = 2 p_1^2 + p_2^2$. Since squares are non-negative, this sum is $\geq 0$, and only zero if $p_1=p_2=0$. (Yes).

**Geometric Meaning:**
This corresponds to a "weighted" Euclidean space. It stretches the $x$-axis by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$. Distances in the $x$-direction "cost" more than in the $y$-direction. The unit circle in this metric would look like an ellipse in standard coordinates.
