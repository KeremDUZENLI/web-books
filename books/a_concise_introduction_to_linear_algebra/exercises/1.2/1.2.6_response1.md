### Answer 1.2.6

In a unit cube, we have edges (length 1), face diagonals (length $\sqrt{2}$), and the main diagonal (length $\sqrt{3}$).

Let's find angles between typical vectors:
* **Edge:** $\mathbf{i} = (1,0,0)$
* **Face Diagonal:** $\mathbf{d}_f = (1,1,0)$
* **Main Diagonal:** $\mathbf{d}_m = (1,1,1)$

**Six Angles:**
1.  **Between Edge and Face Diagonal (adjacent):** $\cos \theta = \frac{1\cdot1}{\sqrt{1}\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \implies 45^\circ$.
2.  **Between Edge and Main Diagonal:** $\cos \theta = \frac{1\cdot1}{\sqrt{1}\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \implies \approx 54.7^\circ$.
3.  **Between Two Face Diagonals (same face):** They intersect at $90^\circ$ (diagonals of a square).
4.  **Between Two Face Diagonals (adjacent faces, meeting at a vertex):** e.g., $(1,1,0)$ and $(1,0,1)$. Dot product = 1. Lengths = $\sqrt{2}$. $\cos \theta = \frac{1}{2} \implies 60^\circ$.
5.  **Between Main Diagonal and Face Diagonal:** $\cos \theta = \frac{(1,1,1)\cdot(1,1,0)}{\sqrt{3}\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} \implies \approx 35.3^\circ$.
6.  **Between Two Main Diagonals:** e.g., $(1,1,1)$ and $(-1,1,1)$. Dot product = 1. Lengths = $\sqrt{3}$. $\cos \theta = \frac{1}{3} \implies \approx 70.5^\circ$.
