### Exercise 1.2.8

Consider a triangle in the $xy$ plane with vertices $A = (1, 3), B = (2, 4),$ and $C = (4, -1)$.

Find:

a. the orthogonal projection of $\mathbf{p} = \overrightarrow{AB}$ onto the line of $\mathbf{q} = \overrightarrow{BC}$,

b. the distance of $A$ from that line, and

c. the area of the triangle.
