### Exercise 1.2.3

Let $P, Q,$ and $R$ be the vertices of a triangle in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$.

Use vectors to show that the line segment joining the midpoints of any two sides of the triangle is parallel to and one half the length of the third side.

*(Note: two vectors are parallel if and only if one is a scalar multiple of the other.)*
