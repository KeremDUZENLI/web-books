### Exercise 1.2.12

Fill in the details of the following, alternative proof of Cauchy’s inequality (Theorem 1.2.6) in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for any $n \geq 2$:

By Part 1 of Theorem 1.2.1, $(\mathbf{p} - \lambda \mathbf{q}) \cdot (\mathbf{p} - \lambda \mathbf{q}) \geq 0$ for every scalar $\lambda$.

Expand the left-hand side to obtain a quadratic function of $\lambda$.
The graph of this function is a parabola above the $\lambda$-axis.

Find the $\lambda$-value of the lowest point in terms of $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$, substitute it into the inequality, and simplify.
