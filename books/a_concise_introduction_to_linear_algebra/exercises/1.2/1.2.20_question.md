### Exercise 1.2.20

Consider an oblique coordinate system in the plane with axes labeled $\xi$ and $\eta$ as shown in Figure 1.21.

Given a vector $\mathbf{p}$, let $p_1$ and $p_2$ denote the orthogonal scalar components of $\mathbf{p}$, that is, the signed lengths of the orthogonal projections of $\mathbf{p}$ onto the axes, and let $p^1$ and $p^2$ denote the parallel scalar components of $\mathbf{p}$.
(Note that in $p^1$ and $p^2$ the 1 and 2 are superscripts, not exponents!)

a. Show that if $\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{q} = |\mathbf{p}| |\mathbf{q}| \cos \theta$ as usual, then $\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{q} = p_1 q^1 + p_2 q^2 = p^1 q_1 + p^2 q_2$.

b. Express $\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{q}$ in the form $\sum_{ij} g_{ij} p^i q^j$, that is, find appropriate constants $g_{ij}$.
