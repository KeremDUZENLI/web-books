### Answer 1.3.9

**Given:** $L_1: (4,3) + t(2,-3)$ and $L_2: (3,2) + t(-1,4)$.

**a. Plotting:**
* **$L_1$:** $t=0 \to (4,3)$; $t=1 \to (6,0)$; $t=-1 \to (2,6)$.
* **$L_2$:** $t=0 \to (3,2)$; $t=1 \to (2,6)$; $t=-1 \to (4,-2)$.
* **Observation:** They intersect at $(2,6)$.

**b. No common $t$:**
For $L_1$, the point $(2,6)$ occurs at $t = -1$.
For $L_2$, the point $(2,6)$ occurs at $t = 1$.
Since $-1 \neq 1$, there is no single value $t$ that puts you at the intersection for both equations simultaneously.

**c. Reparameterization:**
We want $s=0$ to be the intersection $(2,6)$.
* New $L_1$: Start at $(2,6)$ and use direction $(2,-3)$. $\mathbf{p} = (2,6) + s(2,-3)$.
* New $L_2$: Start at $(2,6)$ and use direction $(-1,4)$. $\mathbf{p} = (2,6) + s(-1,4)$.
Now at $s=0$, both lines are at $(2,6)$.
