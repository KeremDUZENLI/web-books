### Exercise 1.3.36

Let $P$ denote a variable point on a line $L$ given by $\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{p}_0 + t\mathbf{v}$, and $Q$ denote any fixed point in space not on $L$.

Show that $\overrightarrow{QP}$ is orthogonal to $\mathbf{v}$ if and only if the distance between $P$ and $Q$ is minimized as a function of $t$.
