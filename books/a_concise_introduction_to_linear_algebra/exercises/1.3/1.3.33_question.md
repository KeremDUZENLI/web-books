### Exercise 1.3.33

Let the equation of a plane $S$ be given in $\mathbb{R}^3$ in the form $\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{p} = d$ with $|\mathbf{n}| = 1$. Let us define a function by $f(\mathbf{q}) = \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{q} - d$, where $\mathbf{q}$ is the position vector of any point $Q$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, whether in $S$ or not.

Show that the value of $f(\mathbf{q})$ equals the signed distance of $Q$ from $S$, which is positive if $\mathbf{n}$ points from $S$ towards $Q$, and negative if $\mathbf{n}$ points from $Q$ towards $S$.
