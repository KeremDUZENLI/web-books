### Exercise 1.3.11

Show that in $\mathbb{R}^n$, for any $n$, $\mathbf{p} = r\mathbf{a} + s\mathbf{b} + t\mathbf{c},$ with $0 \le r, s, t$ and $r + s + t = 1$, represents the points $P$ of a triangle with noncollinear vertices given by the position vectors $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c}$.

(The numbers $r, s, t$ are again called barycentric coordinates of $P$, for a reason similar to the one in the previous exercise.)

Hint: Generalize the solution of Exercise 1.1.9.
