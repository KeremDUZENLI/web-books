### Exercise 1.3.10

Show that in $\mathbb{R}^n$, for any $n$, $\mathbf{p} = t\mathbf{a} + (1 - t)\mathbf{b}$ is a parametric vector equation of the line through the two points with position vectors $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}$.

(The numbers $t$ and $1 - t$ are called barycentric coordinates of $P$, since for $0 \le t \le 1$ this formula gives the center of mass of two point masses of size $t$ and $1 - t$ at $A$ and $B$ respectively (cf. Exercise 1.1.7).)

What is the geometric meaning of $t$ and $1 - t$?

Hint: Write $\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{b} + t(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b})$.
