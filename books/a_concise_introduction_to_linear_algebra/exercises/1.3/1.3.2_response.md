### Answer 1.3.2

**Given:** Point $P_0(1, -2, 4)$ and parallel to the $y$-axis.
The direction of the $y$-axis is $\mathbf{j} = (0, 1, 0)$.

1.  **Parametric Form:**
    $$ (x, y, z) = (1, -2, 4) + t(0, 1, 0) $$
    Components:
    $$ x = 1 $$
    $$ y = -2 + t $$
    $$ z = 4 $$

2.  **Nonparametric Form:**
    Since the direction vector has zeros, we cannot divide by them. The nonparametric form is simply the fixed coordinates:
    $$ x = 1, \quad z = 4 $$
    ($y$ can be anything).
