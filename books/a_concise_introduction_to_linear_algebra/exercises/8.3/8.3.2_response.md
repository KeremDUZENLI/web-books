### Answer 8.3.2

**Eigenvalues of $A$:** 1, 2, 3.
**Eigenvalues of $B = A - cI$:** $1-c, 2-c, 3-c$.

**Goal:** Find $c$ such that $|2-c| > |1-c|$ and $|2-c| > |3-c|$.
This requires the distance from $c$ to 2 to be greater than the distance to 1 and 3.
Let $c$ be real.
$|2-c| > |1-c| \implies (2-c)^2 > (1-c)^2 \implies 4 - 4c > 1 - 2c \implies 3 > 2c \implies c < 1.5$.
$|2-c| > |3-c| \implies (2-c)^2 > (3-c)^2 \implies 4 - 4c > 9 - 6c \implies 2c > 5 \implies c > 2.5$.
There is no $c$ that satisfies $c < 1.5$ AND $c > 2.5$.
Thus, 2 cannot be made the dominant eigenvalue by shifting.
