### Exercise 1.1.4

In $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ the unit cube is defined as the cube with vertices $(0,0,0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1)$.

Find the position vectors (in coordinate form) of:
a. The midpoints of the edges.
b. The centers of the faces.
c. The center of the whole cube.
