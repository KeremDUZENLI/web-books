### Exercise 1.1.9

Let $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c}$ be the position vectors of the vertices of a triangle. The point given by $\mathbf{p}=\frac{1}{3}(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c})$ is the triangle's centroid.

Show that it lies one third of the way from the midpoint of any side to the opposite vertex on the line joining these points (the median).
