### Exercise 1.1.9

Let $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c}$ be the position vectors of the vertices of a triangle.
The point given by $\mathbf{p} = \frac{1}{3}(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c})$ is the triangle's centroid.

Show that it lies one third of the way from the midpoint of any side to the opposite vertex on the line joining these points.
(Such a line is called a median of the triangle.)

Draw an illustration.
