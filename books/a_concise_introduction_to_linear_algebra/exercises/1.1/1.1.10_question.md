### Exercise 1.1.10

Let $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c}, \mathbf{d}$ be the position vectors of the vertices of a tetrahedron.
The point given by $\mathbf{p} = \frac{1}{4}(\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{d})$ is the tetrahedron's centroid.

Show that it lies one fourth of the way from the centroid of the vertices of any face to the opposite vertex on the line joining these points.
(Such a line is called a median of the tetrahedron.)

Draw an illustration.
Notice that the centroid divides each median in the ratio 1 to 3 in contrast to the ratio 1 to 2 for triangles.
Now one vertex balances three vertices instead of two.
