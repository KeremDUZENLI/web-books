### Exercise 1.1.8

Show that the definition of the center of mass, given in Exercise 1.1.7, does not depend on the choice of the point $O$.

That is, if the origin of a new coordinate system is denoted $O'$ and the position vectors relative to it $\mathbf{r}'_i$, then $\mathbf{r}' = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i \mathbf{r}'_i$ gives the position vector of the center of mass in the new system.

(Hint: $\mathbf{r}'_i = \overrightarrow{O'O} + \mathbf{r}_i$.)
