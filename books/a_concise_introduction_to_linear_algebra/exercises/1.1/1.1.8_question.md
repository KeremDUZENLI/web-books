### Exercise 1.1.8

Show that the definition of the center of mass, given in Exercise 1.1.7, does not depend on the choice of the point $O$. That is, if the origin of a new coordinate system is denoted $O^{\prime}$ and the position vectors relative to it are $\mathbf{r}_{i}^{\prime}$, show that the formula $\mathbf{r}^{\prime}=\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{i}\mathbf{r}_{i}^{\prime}$ gives the position vector of the center of mass in the new system.

(Hint: $\mathbf{r}_{i}^{\prime}=\vec{O^{\prime}O}+\mathbf{r}_{i}$. )
