### Exercise 1.1.7

Given $n$ point masses $m_i, i = 1, 2, \dots, n$ at the points with position vectors $\mathbf{r}_i$ in either two or three dimensions, their center of mass is defined as the point with position vector $\mathbf{r} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i \mathbf{r}_i$, where $M = \sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i$ is the total mass.
(If the masses are equal, their center of mass is called their centroid.)

If three mass points are given with $m_1 = 2, m_2 = 3, m_3 = 5, \mathbf{r}_1 = (2, -1, 4), \mathbf{r}_2 = (1, 5, -6),$ and $\mathbf{r}_3 = (-2, -5, 4)$, then find $\mathbf{r}$.
