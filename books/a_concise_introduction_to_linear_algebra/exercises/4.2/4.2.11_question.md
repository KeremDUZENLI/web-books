### Exercise 4.2.11

Find on the space $\mathcal{P}_n$ the representative matrix of the operation $X D - D X$ relative to the ordered basis $A = B = (1, x, \dots, x^n)$.

(Here $X$ is the transformation of multiplication by $x$ as in Exercise 4.1.20, and $D$ is the differentiation map.)

Determine the range and the kernel of this mapping and whether it is one-to-one or onto.
