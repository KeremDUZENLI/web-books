### Exercise 4.2.12

Let $K$ be the $x$-axis in $\mathbb{R}^3$, that is, $K = \{\mathbf{x} : \mathbf{x} = x\mathbf{e}_1, x \in \mathbb{R}\}$.

Show that the complementary subspace $\overline{K}$ of this $K$ as defined in Theorem 4.2.13 is not unique, by exhibiting two different complementary subspaces that both satisfy Equations 4.74 and 4.75.
