### Answer 4.2.10

**Matrix:** $M = T_{A,B}$.
If $T$ is an isomorphism, it is 1-to-1 and Onto.
This implies $dim(U) = dim(V) = n$.
The matrix $M$ is $n \times n$.
Since $T$ is 1-to-1, the columns of $M$ (images of basis vectors) are linearly independent.
An $n \times n$ matrix with independent columns is **nonsingular** (invertible).
**Inverse:** $(T_{A,B})^{-1}$ represents the inverse transformation $T^{-1}$ relative to bases $B$ (input) and $A$ (output).
It is $T^{-1}_{B,A}$.
