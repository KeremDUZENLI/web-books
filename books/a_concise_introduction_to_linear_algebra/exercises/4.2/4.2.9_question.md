### Exercise 4.2.9

* Prove that if $T$ is a one-to-one linear transformation from a vector space $U$ to a vector space $V$, and $dim(U) = dim(V)$, then $T$ is an isomorphism.

(Hint: First show that if $\mathcal{A} = \{\mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2, \dots, \mathbf{a}_n\}$ is a basis for $U$, then the vectors $T(\mathbf{a}_i) = \mathbf{b}_i$, for $i = 1, 2, \dots, n$ form a basis for $V$.)
