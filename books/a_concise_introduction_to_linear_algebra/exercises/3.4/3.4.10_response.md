### Answer 3.4.10

**Proof:**
Let $S = \{\mathbf{v}_1, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n\}$ be independent in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
Form matrix $A$ with these vectors as columns.
Since columns are independent, $Null(A) = \{\mathbf{0}\}$.
By Invertible Matrix Theorem (or rank-nullity), Rank($A$) = $n$.
Since Rank is $n$, the columns span $\mathbb{R}^n$ (pivot in every row).
Since they span and are independent, they form a **basis**.
