### Exercise 3.4.15

Let $A = \text{magic}(4)$.

a. Use `rref` on $A$ and $A^T$ to find a basis for the row space and the column space, respectively. Extract and transpose the appropriate submatrix in each case to obtain two matrices $B$ and $C$ whose columns form the bases. (Such a matrix is called a basis matrix.)

b. The command `D = orth(A)` returns a basis matrix for $Col(A)$ (usually different from the one obtained by `rref`). Show that the columns of $D$ and of the matrix $C$ computed in Part (a) span the same space.

c. Let `U = orth(A')`. Show that the columns of $U$ and of the matrix $B$ computed in Part (a) span the same space.

d. The command `N = null(A)` returns a basis matrix for $Null(A)$. Compute $B^T N$ and explain your result.

e. Compute `M = null(A' * A)` and explain your result.
