### Answer 3.4.15

**a. RREF Bases:**
`[R, pivot_cols] = rref(A)`. $C$ = A(:, pivot_cols).
`[R2, pivot_rows] = rref(A')`. $B$ = (A'( :, pivot_rows))'. (Rows of A corresponding to pivots).

**b. `orth(A)` vs `rref`:**
`D = orth(A)` gives an orthonormal basis.
Span is the same because both sets of basis vectors generate the Column Space.
Check: `rank([D C])` should equal `rank(D)`.

**c. `orth(A')` vs Row Basis:**
Similarly, `orth(A')` gives orthonormal basis for Row Space.
Span matches $B$.

**d. $B^T N$:**
$B$ consists of basis vectors for Row Space (rows of A).
$N$ consists of basis vectors for Null Space.
Row Space is orthogonal to Null Space.
Dot product of any row vector with any null vector is 0.
$B \cdot N = 0$ (matrix product).
Thus, the result should be a matrix of zeros (or near machine epsilon).

**e. `null(A' * A)`:**
This computes the null space of the Gram matrix.
Theorem: $Null(A^T A) = Null(A)$.
So `M` should span the same space as `N`.
