### Answer 3.4.11

**Proof:**
Let $S = \{\mathbf{v}_1, \dots, \mathbf{v}_m\}$ with $m < n$.
Form matrix $A$ ($n \times m$).
The rank of $A$ is at most $m$ (number of columns).
Since $m < n$, Rank $< n$.
This means there cannot be a pivot in every row.
Therefore, the system $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ is not consistent for all $\mathbf{b}$.
Thus, the vectors do not span $\mathbb{R}^n$.
