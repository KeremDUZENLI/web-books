### Exercise 1.2.15

Let $\mathbf{p}$ be any nonzero vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbf{u}_p$ the unit vector in its direction.

a. Show that the vector $\mathbf{p}$ can be written as $\mathbf{p} = |\mathbf{p}| (\cos \phi, \sin \phi)$, where $\phi$ is the angle from the positive $x$-axis to $\mathbf{p}$.

b. Show that $\mathbf{u}_p = (\cos \phi, \sin \phi)$.
