### Exercise 6.1.16

Show, using Theorem 6.1.8 and Equation 6.44 (from Exercise 6.1.14), that the monomials $1, x, x^{2}$ are linearly independent in the vector space $\mathcal{P}$ of all polynomials over $\mathbb{R}$.

(Hint: Substitute three numbers $a, b, c$ for $x$ into the definition of linear independence applied to these functions.)
