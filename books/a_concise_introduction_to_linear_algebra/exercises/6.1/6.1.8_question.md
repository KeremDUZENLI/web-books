### Exercise 6.1.8

Is the analog of Theorem 6.1.7 true for matrices lower triangular with respect to the secondary diagonal, that is, does

$$
\begin{vmatrix}0&0&a_{13}\\ 0&a_{22}&a_{23}\\ a_{31}&a_{32}&a_{33}\end{vmatrix}=-a_{13}a_{22}a_{31}
$$

hold, and similar relations for $n\ne3$? Prove your result!
