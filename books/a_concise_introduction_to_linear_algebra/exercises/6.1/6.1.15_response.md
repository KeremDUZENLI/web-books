### Answer 6.1.15

**General Formula:**
$$ det(V_n) = \prod_{1 \le i < j \le n} (x_j - x_i) $$

**Proof Strategy:**
Perform row operations to zero out the first column (except the top entry).
$R_k \leftarrow R_k - x_1 R_{k-1}$ for $k=n \dots 2$.
Factor out $(x_i - x_1)$ from the remaining columns.
This reduces the determinant to a Vandermonde of order $n-1$.
By induction, the formula holds.
