### Answer 6.1.17

**a. `B = A; B(:,4) = x`:**
This replaces the 4th column of matrix $A$ with the vector $x$, storing the result in $B$.

**b. Linear Dependence:**
If you replace a column with a sum of other columns (e.g., $C_3 = C_1 + C_2$), the determinant becomes 0 because the columns are linearly dependent.
If you multiply a column by $k$, the determinant is multiplied by $k$.

**c. Linearity:**
$det(A+B) \neq det(A) + det(B)$ generally. Determinant is **not** a linear function of the matrix.
However, determinant **is** linear in a single column if other columns are fixed.
If $A = [\mathbf{c}_1 \dots \mathbf{u} \dots \mathbf{c}_n]$ and $B = [\mathbf{c}_1 \dots \mathbf{v} \dots \mathbf{c}_n]$, then $det(A+B)$ doesn't apply directly here, but $det([\mathbf{c}_1 \dots \mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v} \dots]) = det(A) + det(B)$.

**d. Column Operation:**
`B(:,4) = B(:,4) + 3*B(:,1)` adds a multiple of column 1 to column 4.
This is a column operation (shear).
Property: Adding a multiple of one column to another does **not change the determinant**.
Therefore, $det(A) = det(B)$ (ignoring rounding errors).
