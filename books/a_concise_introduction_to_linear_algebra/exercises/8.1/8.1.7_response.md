### Answer 8.1.7

**Gauss-Jordan Method:**
1.  **Forward Elimination ($A \to U$):** Standard Gaussian elimination.
    Ops $\approx n^3/3$.
2.  **Backward Elimination ($U \to I$):**
    Eliminate entries *above* the diagonal using the diagonal pivots.
    Starting from bottom pivot $u_{nn}$.
    For col $n$, eliminate $n-1$ entries above. Each row op affects only the augmented column (since left of pivot is 0).
    Wait, usually Gauss-Jordan is done on $[A|b]$.
    Eliminating above diagonal in augmented matrix:
    At column $k$, we subtract row $k$ from $k-1$ rows above.
    The row $k$ has entries only at $k$ and $n+1$ (augmented).
    So effectively we are just back-substituting.
    However, if we do it for matrix inversion ($[A|I]$), the cost is different.
    For solving $Ax=b$:
    If we reduce to reduced echelon form:
    Forward: $n^3/3$.
    Backward: We operate on the vector $\mathbf{b}$ mostly? No, if we zero out the matrix $A$ above diagonal:
    This is equivalent to back-substitution.
    Ops count: $\sum_{k=1}^n (k-1) \times 1$ (if working only on augmented column)?
    The cost is dominated by the forward pass $n^3/3$.
