### Answer 8.1.1

**Context:**
In $LU$ decomposition, $A = LU$.
$U$ is obtained from $A$ by row operations: $E_k \dots E_1 A = U$.
Thus $A = (E_1^{-1} \dots E_k^{-1}) U$.
$L = (E_1^{-1} \dots E_k^{-1})$.

**Comparison:**
The product of the elementary matrices $E$ (as they appear in the elimination steps $E_{ij}$) is the inverse of $L$.
Specifically, if $L$ is the lower triangular matrix with multipliers $l_{ij}$ below the diagonal, then the product of the elementary matrices that reduce $A$ to $U$ is $L^{-1}$.
Conversely, $L$ is the product of the inverses of the elementary matrices:
$L = E_{21}^{-1} E_{31}^{-1} \dots$
The key observation is that while the product of $E$ matrices (in elimination order) mixes entries, the product of their inverses (in reverse order to form $L$) simply places the multipliers $l_{ij}$ into the corresponding positions in the lower triangle without mixing, provided the elimination is done in the standard order (column by column).
