### Answer 8.1.10

**MATLAB/Octave Procedure:**

```matlab
% Example for one instance
A = round(10*rand(4,5));
[L, U, P] = lu(A);

% Extract D from U
% D should be diagonal of U's pivots.
% U_new should have 1s on diagonal.
D_diag = diag(U);
D = diag(D_diag);

% Compute U_new. Note: If a pivot is 0, we can't divide.
% Ideally A is non-singular square for standard LDU.
% For rectangular, D is square size of rank?
% Assuming full rank for random matrices:
U_new = D \ U; % U_new = inv(D) * U

% Check LDU = PA
Check = norm(L * D * U_new - P * A);
disp(Check);

```

**Steps:**

1. Compute `[L, U, P] = lu(A)`.
2. Construct `D` from the main diagonal of `U`.
3. Compute normalized `U_hat = inv(D) * U`.
4. Verify `L * D * U_hat` equals `P * A`.
(Random matrices are usually non-singular, so division by diagonal elements is safe).
