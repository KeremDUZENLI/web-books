### Answer 8.2.9

**Hilbert Matrix:**
`A = hilb(12)` is notoriously ill-conditioned. `cond(A)` is approx $10^{16}$ or more.
This exceeds the precision of standard double-precision floating point ($\approx 16$ digits).

**Results:**
1.  `x = A\b`: MATLAB uses LU factorization with pivoting. It detects the singularity/ill-conditioning and will likely issue a warning ("Matrix is close to singular or badly scaled"). The result `x` will have significant error compared to `c` (ones).
2.  `x = rref([A b])`: RREF operations are very sensitive to round-off errors. With such a high condition number, the pivot determinations will be garbage (zeros might not be exactly zero). The resulting vector `x` (last column) will likely be nonsense or very far from `c`.

**Lesson:**
For ill-conditioned systems, standard algorithms fail to produce accurate results because the errors in the input/arithmetic are amplified by the condition number.
