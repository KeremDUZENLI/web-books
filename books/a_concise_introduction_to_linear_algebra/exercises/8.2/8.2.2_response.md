### Answer 8.2.2

**System:**
$$ \left[ \begin{array}{cc|c} 2 & 1000 & 4000 \\ 6 & -1 & 2 \end{array} \right] $$
This system is the same as 8.2.1 but Row 1 is multiplied by 1000.
Mathematically, the solution is identical ($x_1 \approx 1, x_2 \approx 4$).

**Machine Execution:**
Multiplier $m = 6/2 = 3$.
$R_2 \leftarrow R_2 - 3R_1$.
$a_{22} = -1 - 3(1000) = -3001 \to -3000$ (3 digits).
$b_2 = 2 - 3(4000) = -11998 \to -12000$ (3 digits).
$x_2 = -12000 / -3000 = 4$.
$2 x_1 + 1000(4) = 4000 \implies 2x_1 = 0 \implies x_1 = 0$.

**Conclusion:**
Scaling a row does **not** fix the numerical instability caused by the relative size of the coefficients in the elimination steps if precision is limited. The "large" numbers still swamp the small ones during subtraction.
