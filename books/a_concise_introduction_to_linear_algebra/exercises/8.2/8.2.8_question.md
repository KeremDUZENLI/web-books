### Exercise 8.2.8

Enter the augmented matrix of Equation 8.49 ($[A|\mathbf{b}]'=\begin{bmatrix}12&7&4&8&44\\ 15&13&-22&1&2\\ -7&-11&53&32&12\\ 0&12&-7&1&11\end{bmatrix}$) as $A$ in MATLAB and run the command `rrefmovie(A)`.

a. Compare the observed sequence of operations to achieve Gauss-Jordan reduction to the one suggested in Exercise 8.1.7 on page 299. Which one is more efficient? How many long operations are needed in this method? (You can actually count all operations by using the MATLAB command `flops`. See `help flops`.)

b. Are the rows used in the same order as in Example 8.2.2? What is the difference? Which method is preferable, in general?
