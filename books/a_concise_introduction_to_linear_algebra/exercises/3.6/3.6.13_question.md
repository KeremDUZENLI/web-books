### Exercise 3.6.13

Suppose $M$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, representing a mapping from $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{m}$. If we change from the standard basis $I_{n}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to an arbitrary ordered basis $A$, and from $I_{m}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ to some $B$, then find the representation $M_{A,B}$ of $M$ relative to the new bases.
