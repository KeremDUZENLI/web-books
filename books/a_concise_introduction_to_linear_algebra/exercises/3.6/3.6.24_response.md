### Answer 3.6.24

**Algorithm:**
1.  **Basis B:** Columns of `rref(A)` are the pivot columns. So $B$ consists of the columns of $A$ corresponding to pivots.
    MATLAB: `[R, p] = rref(A); B = A(:, p);`
2.  **Basis C:** `C = orth(A)`. Orthonormal basis for Col(A).
3.  **Transition $B \to C$:**
    We want $S$ such that $B S = C$ is not quite right.
    Basis $B = \{\mathbf{b}_i\}$. Basis $C = \{\mathbf{c}_i\}$.
    Vectors are columns of matrices $M_B$ and $M_C$.
    A vector $\mathbf{v}$ in subspace can be written as $M_B [\mathbf{v}]_B = M_C [\mathbf{v}]_C$.
    So $[\mathbf{v}]_C = M_C^T M_B [\mathbf{v}]_B$ (since $M_C$ is orthogonal, $M_C^{-1} = M_C^T$).
    Transition matrix $S_{B \to C} = M_C^T M_B$.
    In MATLAB: `S = C' * B`.
    
    *(Note: Theorem 3.6.2 says $AS=B$ for transition $S$. If matrices are $M_B$ and $M_C$, and we want $[\mathbf{v}]_C = S [\mathbf{v}]_B$, then $M_C S = M_B$. So $S = M_C^{-1} M_B$. Since $C$ is `orth`, $M_C^{-1} = M_C^T$.)*
