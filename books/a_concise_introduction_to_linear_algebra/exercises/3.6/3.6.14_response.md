### Answer 3.6.14

**Matrix:** $M(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & t \\ 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}$.
Eigenvalues are $\lambda_1 = 1, \lambda_2 = 2$.
Since eigenvalues are distinct, $M(t)$ is diagonalizable for any $t$.
$M(t) \sim \Lambda = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}$.
Since similarity is transitive, and all $M(t)$ are similar to the same diagonal matrix $\Lambda$, they are all similar to each other.
Specifically, $M(t) = S_t \Lambda S_t^{-1}$.
$S_t^{-1} M(t) S_t = \Lambda$.
$S_{t'} \Lambda S_{t'}^{-1} = M(t')$.
Combining gives the similarity transform between $M(t)$ and $M(t')$.
(Note: This requires $t$ to not affect the distinctness of eigenvalues, which is true here).
