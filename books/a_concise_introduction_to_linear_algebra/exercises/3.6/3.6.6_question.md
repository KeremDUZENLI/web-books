### Exercise 3.6.6

In $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ the matrix
$$
M = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$
represents the projection onto the $x_{1}$-axis. Find its representation $M_{A}$ relative to the basis $(\mathbf{a}_{1},\mathbf{a}_{2})$ obtained from the standard basis by a rotation through an angle $\theta$.
