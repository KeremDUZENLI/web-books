### Exercise 3.6.20

The sum of the diagonal elements of a square matrix is called its trace: For an $n \times n$ matrix $Tr(A)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{ii}$.

a. Show that if $A$ and $B$ are $n \times n$ matrices, then $Tr(AB)=Tr(BA)$.

b. Apply the result of Part a to $S$ and $BS^{-1}$ to show that if $A$ and $B$ are similar so that $A=SBS^{-1}$, then $Tr(A)=Tr(B)$.

c. Is $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 4 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$ similar to $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$?
