### Exercise 2.5.12

The matrix
$$ E = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ c & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} $$
is obtained from the unit matrix $I$ by the elementary row operation of adding $c$ times its first row to its second row. Show that for every $3 \times 3$ matrix $A$ the same elementary row operation performed on $A$ results in the product matrix $EA$. Also, find $E^{-1}$ and describe the elementary row operation it corresponds to. (A matrix that produces the same effect by multiplication as an elementary row operation, like this $E$ and the matrices $P$ in the next two exercises, is called an elementary matrix.)
