### Exercise 2.5.21

Let $A = \text{round}(10*\text{rand}(4))$, $B = \text{triu}(A)$, and $C = \text{tril}(A)$.

a. Find the inverses of $B$ and $C$ in format rat by using rref if they exist, and verify that they are inverses indeed.

b. Repeat Part (a) five times. (Use the up-arrow key.)

c. Do you see any pattern? Make a conjecture and prove it.
