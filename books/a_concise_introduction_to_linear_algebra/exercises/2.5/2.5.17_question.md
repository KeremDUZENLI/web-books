### Exercise 2.5.17

A square matrix with a single 1 in each row and in each column and zeros everywhere else is called a permutation matrix.

a. List all six $3 \times 3$ permutation matrices $P$ and their inverses.

b. Show that, for every such $P$ and for every $3 \times n$ matrix $A$, $PA$ equals the matrix obtained from $A$ by the permutation of its rows that is the same as the permutation of the rows of $I$ that results in $P$.

c. What is $BP$ if $B$ is $n \times 3$?
