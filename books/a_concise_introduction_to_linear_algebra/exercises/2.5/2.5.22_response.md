### Answer 2.5.22

**a. $AX=I$ ($3 \times 5$ matrix):**
A $3 \times 5$ random matrix usually has Rank 3.
It has a **Right Inverse**.
Use `rref([A eye(3)])`. The last 3 columns (if pivots are in 1,2,3) give a particular right inverse (with last 2 rows of $X$ zero).

**b. Verify:**
Check `A * X - eye(3)` is near zero.

**c. Backslash:**
`X = A \ eye(3)` in MATLAB usually computes the least-norm solution or a basic solution. It acts as a right inverse.

**d. $YA=I$ (Left Inverse):**
Rank is 3. Rows are 3. Cols are 5.
Left inverse requires Rank = 5. Impossible.
$YA=I$ has **no solution** for a rectangular wide matrix ($m < n$).
**Conclusion:** Wide matrices (full row rank) have right inverses but no left inverses.
