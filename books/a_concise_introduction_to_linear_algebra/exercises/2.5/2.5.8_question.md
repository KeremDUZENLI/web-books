### Exercise 2.5.8

a. Given the $2 \times 3$ matrix
$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 & 4 \\ 4 & -1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} $$
find all $3 \times 2$ matrices $X$ by Gauss-Jordan elimination such that $AX = I$ holds. (Such a matrix is called a right inverse of $A$.)

b. Can you find a $3 \times 2$ matrix $Y$ such that $YA = I$ holds?
