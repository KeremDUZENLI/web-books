### Exercise 2.5.22

Let $A = \text{round}(10*\text{rand}(3,5))$.

a. Find a solution for $AX = I$ by using rref, or show that no solution exists.

b. If you have found a solution, verify that it satisfies $AX = I$.

c. If there is a solution, compute $A \backslash \text{eye}(3)$ and check whether it is a solution.

d. If there is a solution of $AX = I$ try to find a solution for $YA = I$ by using rref. (Hint: Rewrite this equation as $A^T Y^T = I$ first.) Draw a conclusion.

e. Repeat all of the above three times.
