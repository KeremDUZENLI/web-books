### Exercise 5.1.24

Use the method of Exercise 5.1.22 and Equations 5.38 through 5.40 to find the plane that best fits the points $(1, 2, 3)$, $(2, 2, 4)$, $(-1, 0, 3)$, $(5, -2, 2)$, and $(7, 0, -1)$.

(You may also want to use MATLAB to plot these points and the plane in a three-dimensional coordinate system.)
