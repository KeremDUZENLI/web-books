### Exercise 5.1.13

What is wrong with the following “proof” of Theorem 5.1.3?

As we have seen, $A(A^T A)^{-1}A^T$ represents the projection onto $Col(A)$. Substituting $P$ for $A$ into this expression and making use of Properties 1 and 2 of projection matrices in Definition 5.1.3, we get the projection matrix representing the projection onto $Col(P)$ as $P(P^T P)^{-1}P^T = P(PP)^{-1}P = P P^{-1}P = P$.
