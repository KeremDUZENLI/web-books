### Answer 5.1.19

**Proof:**
Look at the third equation in the system from 5.1.18 (derived from the column of 1s).
$$ c_1 \sum x_i + c_2 \sum y_i + c_3 m = \sum z_i $$
Divide the entire equation by $m$ (number of points):
$$ c_1 \frac{\sum x_i}{m} + c_2 \frac{\sum y_i}{m} + c_3 = \frac{\sum z_i}{m} $$
$$ c_1 \bar{x} + c_2 \bar{y} + c_3 = \bar{z} $$
This equation states that the centroid $(\bar{x}, \bar{y}, \bar{z})$ satisfies the plane equation.
