### Answer 5.1.13

**The flaw:**
The substitution "Substituting $P$ for $A$" implies we are calculating the projection onto the column space of $P$.
The formula $A(A^T A)^{-1} A^T$ is valid **only if the columns of A are linearly independent**.
A projection matrix $P$ is usually square ($n \times n$). If it projects onto a proper subspace (rank $r < n$), its columns are **dependent**.
Therefore, the matrix $P^T P = P^2 = P$ is singular (not invertible).
The expression $(P^T P)^{-1}$ does not exist.
The proof fails at the inversion step.
