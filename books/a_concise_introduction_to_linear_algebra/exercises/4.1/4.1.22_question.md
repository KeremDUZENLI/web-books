### Exercise 4.1.22

Let $A = \text{magic}(4)$.

a. Use `rref` on $A$ and $A^T$ to find a basis $B$ for $A$'s row space and a basis $C$ for its column space.

b. Find the matrix $[T]$ of the linear transformation from $Row(A)$ to $Col(A)$ that maps the basis $B$ to the basis $C$, relative to the standard basis.

c. Find the matrix $T_{B,C}$ of the same linear transformation relative to the bases $B$ and $C$.
