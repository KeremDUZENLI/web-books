### Exercise 4.1.3

* Is it true that a mapping from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$ is linear if and only if it preserves straight lines, that is, if and only if, given any $\mathbf{x}_0$ and $\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ the vectors $\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}_0 + t\mathbf{a}$ for every scalar $t$, are mapped into vectors $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{y}_0 + t\mathbf{b}$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$?

If this is true, prove it, and if not, then prove an appropriate modification.
