### Answer 3.3.14

**Proof:**
Let the set be $S = \{\mathbf{v}_1, \dots, \mathbf{v}_k, \mathbf{0}\}$.
Consider the linear combination:
$0\mathbf{v}_1 + \dots + 0\mathbf{v}_k + 1\mathbf{0}$.
This sum equals $\mathbf{0}$.
The coefficients are $\{0, \dots, 0, 1\}$.
Since at least one coefficient (the one for the zero vector) is nonzero, the relation is non-trivial.
Thus, the set is dependent.
