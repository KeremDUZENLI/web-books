### Answer 3.3.13

**Characterizations of Independence for vectors $\mathbf{a}_1, \dots, \mathbf{a}_n$:**
1.  **Definition:** The only solution to $c_1\mathbf{a}_1 + \dots + c_n\mathbf{a}_n = \mathbf{0}$ is the trivial solution $c_1 = \dots = c_n = 0$.
2.  **Linear Combination:** No vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others.
3.  **Rank:** The matrix $A = [\mathbf{a}_1 \dots \mathbf{a}_n]$ has rank $n$ (Full Column Rank).
