# Chapter 6.2: Further Properties of Determinants

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter introduces **cofactor expansion**, a recursive method for evaluating determinants of any size by breaking them down into smaller sub-determinants (minors).

- It connects determinants directly to solving linear systems via **Cramer's Rule** and finding matrix inverses using the **adjoint matrix**, and establishes the geometric role of determinants as the unique functions for calculating **area** and **volume**.

## Keywords

**Minor ($M_{ij}$):**

- The determinant of the submatrix obtained by deleting the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of a matrix $A$.

**Cofactor ($A_{ij}$):**

- A "signed" minor, calculated as $(-1)^{i+j}$ times the minor; the sign follows a checkerboard pattern.

**Adjoint Matrix ($adj(A)$):**

- The transpose of the matrix formed by all the cofactors of $A$; it is used to compute the inverse of a matrix explicitly.

**Cramer's Rule:**

- A formula for solving a system of linear equations ($Ax=b$) where each variable is the ratio of two determinants.

**Area Function:**

- A mathematical definition characterizing the determinant as the unique function that measures the signed area of the parallelogram spanned by two vectors.

## Formulas

**Cofactor Expansion (Row)**

- **Formula:** $|A| = a_{i1}A_{i1} + a_{i2}A_{i2} + \dots + a_{in}A_{in}$

- **Meaning:** The determinant is the sum of the entries of any row multiplied by their corresponding cofactors.

- **Use in graphics:** Recursively calculating determinants for small matrices (like $3 \times 3$ or $4 \times 4$) used in transformations.

**Cramer's Rule**

- **Formula:** $x_i = \frac{\det(A_i)}{\det(A)}$

- **Meaning:** The solution for the $i$-th variable is the determinant of $A$ with its $i$-th column replaced by the vector $b$, divided by the determinant of $A$.

- **Use in graphics:** Solving for intersection parameters (e.g., ray-triangle intersection) symbolically without matrix inversion.

**Matrix Inverse Formula**

- **Formula:** $A^{-1} = \frac{1}{|A|} adj(A)$

- **Meaning:** The inverse is the adjoint matrix scaled by the reciprocal of the determinant.

- **Use in graphics:** Computing the inverse of a transformation matrix (like a camera view matrix) in closed form.

**Area of Triangle**

- **Formula:** $\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| \det \begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2 & 1 \\ b_1 & b_2 & 1 \\ c_1 & c_2 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \right|$

- **Meaning:** Calculates the area of a 2D triangle given the coordinates of its three vertices.

- **Use in graphics:** Computing surface areas for lighting calculations or physics simulations.

## Practical Use

**Geometric Primitives**

- Determinants provide a compact way to write the equation of a line passing through two points or a circle passing through three points (by checking if a determinant involving variable coordinates is zero).

**Symbolic Inversion**

- Unlike algorithmic row reduction, the adjoint formula allows for deriving symbolic expressions for the inverse of a matrix, which is useful for analyzing theoretical properties of transformations.

**Orientation and Signed Area**

- The sign of the determinant in the area function tells us the orientation (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise) of the vectors defining the shape, which is crucial for culling back-facing polygons.
