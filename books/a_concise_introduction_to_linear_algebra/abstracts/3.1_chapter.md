# Chapter 3.1: General Vector Spaces

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter generalizes the concept of "vectors" from geometric arrows in $\mathbb{R}^n$ to abstract objects (such as functions, matrices, or polynomials) that satisfy a specific set of algebraic rules (axioms).

- It matters for computer graphics because it provides the mathematical framework to manipulate complex data types—like animation curves (polynomials), color spaces, and transformation matrices—using the same linear algebra tools used for 3D geometry.

## Keywords

**Vector Space ($V$):**

- A non-empty set of objects (vectors) on which two operations—addition and scalar multiplication—are defined and satisfy ten fundamental axioms (rules).

**Axioms:**

- The required properties (Closure, Associativity, Commutativity, Identity, Inverse, Distributivity) that a set must possess to be treated mathematically as a vector space.

**Closure:**

- The property that performing vector operations (adding two vectors or scaling a vector) always results in an object that remains inside the set.

**Function Space:**

- A vector space where the elements are functions rather than coordinate lists; crucial for signal processing and animation.

## Formulas

**Closure under Addition**

- **Formula:** If $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in V$, then $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \in V$

- **Meaning:** Adding two vectors from the space produces a result that is also in the space.

- **Use in graphics:** Ensuring that blending two textures or mixing two animations produces a valid result.

**Closure under Scalar Multiplication**

- **Formula:** If $\mathbf{u} \in V$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$, then $c\mathbf{u} \in V$

- **Meaning:** Scaling a vector by a real number keeps it within the space.

- **Use in graphics:** Adjusting the intensity of a light source or scaling a 3D model.

**Zero Vector (Additive Identity)**

- **Formula:** $\exists \mathbf{0} \in V$ such that $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{u}$

- **Meaning:** There exists a "neutral" element that makes no change when added.

- **Use in graphics:** Represents "no displacement" in animation or "black" in additive color models.

## Practical Use

**Curve Modeling (Splines)**

- Treating polynomials as vectors allows graphics engines to blend shapes (morphing) or smooth animation curves using linear algebra operations.

**Image Processing**

- Treating images as vectors in a high-dimensional space allows for operations like averaging faces (eigenfaces) or compression.

**Color Operations**

- RGB colors form a vector space where addition represents mixing light and scalar multiplication represents changing brightness.
