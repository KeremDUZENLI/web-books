# Chapter 3.2: Subspaces

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter defines a subspace as a smaller, self-contained vector space that sits inside a larger vector space (e.g., a plane passing through the origin inside 3D space).

- It explains that to verify if a subset is a subspace, you only need to check three simple conditions rather than all ten vector space axioms.

- This matters for computer graphics because subspaces represent geometric constraints (like a character walking on a flat floor) and solution sets for linear systems (like finding valid camera configurations).

## Keywords

**Subspace:**

- A subset of a vector space that is itself a vector space; it must contain the zero vector and be closed under addition and scalar multiplication.

**Closure Rules (The Subspace Test):**

- The specific criteria used to check if a subset is a subspace: it must not "leak" when you add vectors or scale them.

**Trivial Subspace:**

- The subspace consisting only of the zero vector $\{\mathbf{0}\}$, which is technically the smallest possible vector space.

**Proper Subspace:**

- Any subspace that is not the entire original space (e.g., a line in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is a proper subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$).

## Formulas

**The Subspace Test**

- **Formula:** A subset $W$ is a subspace if:

  1. $\mathbf{0} \in W$

  2. If $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \in W$, then $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} \in W$

  3. If $\mathbf{u} \in W$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$, then $c\mathbf{u} \in W$

- **Meaning:** If you start with vectors in the set and combine them linearly, you never leave the set.

- **Use in graphics:** Verifying that a constrained movement system (like a sliding door) is mathematically consistent.

**Intersection of Subspaces**

- **Formula:** $W_1 \cap W_2$ is a subspace.

- **Meaning:** The overlap of two subspaces is also a valid subspace.

- **Use in graphics:** Finding the allowable movement range for a robot arm joint that is restricted by two different physical barriers.

## Practical Use

**Planar Constraints**

- Modeling a 2D surface (like a shadow plane or a mirror) within a 3D scene as a subspace to simplify calculations for objects attached to that surface.

**Color Gamuts**

- Representing the range of displayable colors on a specific monitor as a subspace of the full visible spectrum (though often restricted to a cone/convex hull).

**Linear Solvers**

- Understanding that the solutions to a homogeneous linear system ($Ax=0$) form a subspace (the "Null Space"), which tells you about the system's degrees of freedom.
