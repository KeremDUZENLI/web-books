# Chapter 3.3: Span and Independence of Vectors

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter explains how to construct new vectors by mixing existing ones (linear combinations) and determines if a set of vectors contains redundant information (independence).

- This is fundamental to computer graphics for defining coordinate systems, minimizing memory usage (by removing redundant vectors), and creating meshes using barycentric coordinates.

## Keywords

**Linear Combination:**

- A vector formed by multiplying a set of vectors by scalar weights and adding the results together.

**Span:**

- The set of all possible vectors that can be created via linear combinations of a specific list of vectors; essentially, the geometric "space" covered by those vectors.

**Linear Independence:**

- A property of a set of vectors where no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others; each vector adds a new dimension to the span.

**Linear Dependence:**

- The opposite of independence; implies that at least one vector is redundant and can be removed without shrinking the span.

## Formulas

**Linear Combination**

- **Formula:** $\mathbf{v} = c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2\mathbf{v}_2 + \dots + c_k\mathbf{v}_k$

- **Meaning:** Constructing a new vector $\mathbf{v}$ by scaling and adding building blocks ($\mathbf{v}_i$).

- **Use in graphics:** Skeletal animation (blending bone positions) or color mixing.

**Test for Independence**

- **Formula:** $c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + \dots + c_k\mathbf{v}_k = \mathbf{0} \implies c_1 = \dots = c_k = 0$

- **Meaning:** The only way to combine independent vectors to get zero is to multiply them all by zero.

- **Use in graphics:** Checking if a geometric primitive (like a triangle) has zero area (degenerate).

## Practical Use

**Coordinate Axes**

- The X, Y, and Z axes are useful because they are linearly independent; they span the entire 3D space, allowing any point to be defined by a unique coordinate triplet.

**Degenerate Geometry Detection**

- If the vertices of a triangle are linearly dependent (collinear), the triangle has no area and will not render correctly; checking independence prevents these errors.

**Barycentric Coordinates**

- Representing any point inside a triangle as a linear combination of the three vertex vectors; essential for texture mapping and ray-triangle intersection.
