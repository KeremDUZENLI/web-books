# Chapter 6.1: Determinants: Definition and Basic Properties

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter defines determinants as specific functions of square matrices that are used to compute areas and volumes and to identify singular (non-invertible) matrices.

- It establishes the determinant's behavior through three fundamental axioms and derives explicit formulas for calculation, linking the algebraic value to the geometric concept of volume scaling.

## Keywords

**Determinant:**

- A scalar value assigned to a square matrix that characterizes properties like invertibility and volume scaling; defined by axioms of multilinearity, alternating columns, and normalization.

**Singular Matrix:**

- A matrix that does not have an inverse; characterized by having a determinant of zero, which geometrically implies the transformation collapses volume into a lower dimension.

**Permutation:**

- A specific arrangement of the integers $1$ to $n$; the general formula for determinants sums the products of matrix entries according to all possible permutations of column indices.

**Upper Triangular Matrix:**

- A matrix where all entries below the main diagonal are zero; its determinant is simply the product of its diagonal elements.

## Formulas

**2x2 Determinant**

- **Formula:** $|A| = a_{11}a_{22} - a_{21}a_{12}$

- **Meaning:** The product of the main diagonal minus the product of the off-diagonal.

- **Use in graphics:** Calculating the area of a 2D parallelogram or checking triangle orientation (winding order).

**3x3 Determinant**

- **Formula:** $|A| = a_{11}a_{22}a_{33} + a_{21}a_{32}a_{13} + a_{31}a_{12}a_{23} - (a_{11}a_{32}a_{23} + a_{21}a_{12}a_{33} + a_{31}a_{22}a_{13})$

- **Meaning:** The sum of forward diagonal products minus the sum of backward diagonal products.

- **Use in graphics:** Computing the volume of a 3D parallelepiped or finding cross products.

**Determinant of a Product**

- **Formula:** $|AB| = |A||B|$

- **Meaning:** The determinant of a matrix product is the product of the individual determinants.

- **Use in graphics:** Calculating the total scaling factor of a composite transformation sequence.

**Singularity Condition**

- **Formula:** $A \text{ is singular } \iff |A| = 0$

- **Meaning:** A matrix has no inverse if and only if its determinant is zero.

- **Use in graphics:** Detecting degenerate geometry or invalid camera transformations that squash the scene.

**Transpose Property**

- **Formula:** $|A^T| = |A|$

- **Meaning:** Transposing a matrix (swapping rows and columns) does not change its determinant.

- **Use in graphics:** Allows algorithms to work interchangeably on row-major or column-major matrices.

## Practical Use

**Volume Calculation**

- The absolute value of the determinant represents the volume (or area in 2D) of the parallelepiped spanned by the column vectors of the matrix.

**Invertibility Check**

- Checking if the determinant is non-zero is the standard theoretical test to ensure a matrix can be inverted, which is essential for solving linear systems.

**Orientation Detection**

- The sign of the determinant indicates whether a transformation preserves or reverses orientation (e.g., determining if a shape has been mirrored/flipped).
