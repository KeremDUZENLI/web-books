# Chapter 3.4: Bases

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter introduces the concept of a **basis**: a specific set of vectors that is both large enough to span a space and small enough to be linearly independent.

- A basis provides a minimal, efficient, and unique coordinate system for describing every vector in a space.

- This matters for computer graphics because it allows us to define local coordinate systems (like "Object Space" or "Camera Space") and switch between them efficiently.

## Keywords

**Basis:**

- A set of vectors in a vector space that is linearly independent and spans the entire space.

**Standard Basis:**

- The simplest, most natural basis for a space (e.g., $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ for $\mathbb{R}^2$); it aligns with the coordinate axes.

**Coordinates relative to a Basis:**

- The unique set of scalar weights needed to construct a vector using a specific basis; these scalars are what we store as $(x, y, z)$ data.

**Non-Standard Basis:**

- A basis consisting of vectors that are not the standard unit vectors (e.g., rotated or scaled axes), often used to align coordinates with an object's orientation.

## Formulas

**Unique Representation**

- **Formula:** If $\mathcal{B} = \{ \mathbf{v}_1, \dots, \mathbf{v}_n \}$ is a basis, then for any $\mathbf{x} \in V$, there is a unique set of scalars $c_i$ such that $\mathbf{x} = c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + \dots + c_n\mathbf{v}_n$.

- **Meaning:** Every point in space has exactly one "address" (coordinate set) for a given coordinate system.

- **Use in graphics:** Uniquely identifying vertex positions relative to a mesh's center.

**Coordinate Vector**

- **Formula:** $[\mathbf{x}]_\mathcal{B} = \begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\ \vdots \\ c_n \end{bmatrix}$

- **Meaning:** The list of scalars (coordinates) that describe vector $\mathbf{x}$ using basis $\mathcal{B}$.

- **Use in graphics:** Storing vector data in memory buffers (VBOs).

**Change of Basis Matrix**

- **Formula:** $P_{\mathcal{B} \to \mathcal{C}} = \begin{bmatrix} [\mathbf{b}_1]_\mathcal{C} & \dots & [\mathbf{b}_n]_\mathcal{C} \end{bmatrix}$

- **Meaning:** A matrix constructed by columns that converts coordinates from basis $\mathcal{B}$ to basis $\mathcal{C}$.

- **Use in graphics:** The mathematical core of the "View Matrix" (converting World Basis to Camera Basis).

## Practical Use

**Local Coordinate Systems**

- Every 3D model has its own "Object Basis" where the origin is its center and the axes align with its orientation; this simplifies modeling and animation.

**Camera Transformations**

- The camera defines a basis (Right, Up, Forward vectors); rendering a scene involves re-expressing all world geometry in terms of this camera basis.

**Texture Mapping (Tangent Space)**

- Normal mapping uses a special basis (Tangent, Bitangent, Normal) calculated at every vertex to correctly light curved surfaces using flat textures.
