# Chapter 1.3: Lines and Planes

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter explains how to represent lines and planes mathematically in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space using vectors.

- It matters for computer graphics because lines are used to model rays (for ray tracing) and edges, while planes are fundamental for defining polygons, creating clipping boundaries, and constructing 3D geometry.

## Keywords

**Parametric Vector Equation:**

- A method of describing a geometric shape (line or plane) using a starting point and one or more direction vectors scaled by variable parameters.

**Direction Vector:**

- A vector that defines the orientation of a line; it determines the direction of "motion" as the parameter changes.

**Normal Vector:**

- A vector perpendicular to a plane that defines the plane's orientation in space, crucial for calculating lighting and collisions.

**Hyperplane:**

- The generalization of a plane to $n$-dimensions (defined by one linear equation), which divides the space into two halves.

## Formulas

**Line Equation (Parametric)**

- **Formula:** $p = p_0 + t v$

- **Meaning:** Any point $p$ on the line is reachable from start point $p_0$ by moving distance $t$ along direction $v$.

- **Use in graphics:** Modeling light rays (ray tracing) or projectile paths.

**Plane Equation (Parametric)**

- **Formula:** $p = p_0 + s u + t v$

- **Meaning:** A point on the plane is found by moving from $p_0$ along two independent directions $u$ and $v$.

- **Use in graphics:** Texture mapping or generating surface points.

**Plane Equation (Nonparametric/Implicit)**

- **Formula:** $n \cdot (p - p_0) = 0$ or $ax + by + cz = d$

- **Meaning:** The set of all points $p$ such that the vector connecting them to $p_0$ is perpendicular to the normal $n$.

- **Use in graphics:** Clipping geometry against a boundary or checking if a point is "inside" or "outside" a volume.

**Line-Line Intersection**

- **Formula:** Solve $(4,3,9) + s(2,-3,7) = (3,2,0) + t(-1,4,2)$ for $s$ and $t$.

- **Meaning:** Equating two parametric lines to find if and where they meet.

- **Use in graphics:** Determining collision points between moving objects.

**Distance (Point to Plane)**

- **Formula:** $D = \frac{|(p - p_0) \cdot n|}{|n|}$

- **Meaning:** The length of the projection of the vector from the plane to the point onto the plane's normal.

- **Use in graphics:** Collision detection (e.g., keeping a camera above the ground).

## Practical Use

**Ray Casting**

- Using the parametric line equation to shoot rays from a camera pixel into a 3D scene to detect objects.

**Clipping**

- Using the implicit plane equation to cut off parts of 3D models that fall outside the viewable screen area (frustum culling).

**Surface Orientation**

- Using the normal vector of a plane to determine which way a polygon is facing, which is essential for calculating how light reflects off it.
