# Chapter 4.3: Applications of Linear Transformations in Computer Graphics

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter introduces **homogeneous coordinates**, a mathematical "trick" that adds an extra dimension to vectors, allowing non-linear operations like **translation** (movement) to be represented as standard matrix multiplications.

- This enables computer graphics systems to combine all geometric transformations (rotation, scaling, translation, projection) into single, efficient composite matrices for animating objects like robot arms or rendering 3D scenes.

## Keywords

**Homogeneous Coordinates:**

- The system of representing a 2D vector $(x, y)$ as a 3D vector $(x, y, 1)$ (or 3D to 4D); this allows translations to be treated as linear transformations.

**Translation Matrix:**

- A matrix that shifts points by a constant vector; in homogeneous coordinates, the shift values are stored in the last column, leaving the rest as an identity structure.

**Composite Transformation:**

- A complex operation formed by multiplying simple transformation matrices in sequence (e.g., $T \cdot R \cdot T^{-1}$); the order is crucial (right-to-left application).

**Orthographic Projection:**

- A method of "flattening" 3D objects onto a 2D viewing plane by dropping the coordinate perpendicular to the plane (like a shadow cast by a distant light).

## Formulas

**2D Translation Matrix (Homogeneous)**

- **Formula:** $T(t_1, t_2) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & t_1 \\ 0 & 1 & t_2 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$

- **Meaning:** Maps $(x, y, 1)$ to $(x+t_1, y+t_2, 1)$, effectively adding $t$ to the position.

- **Use in graphics:** Moving sprites or 3D models around a scene.

**Rotation About a Pivot Point**

- **Formula:** $M = T(p) R(\theta) T(-p)$

- **Meaning:** To rotate around a specific point $p$: shift $p$ to the origin ($T(-p)$), rotate ($R(\theta)$), then shift back ($T(p)$).

- **Use in graphics:** Animating joints, like a robot arm rotating around an elbow rather than the world origin.

**Orthographic Projection Formula**

- **Formula:** $p_V = (p \cdot u)u + (p \cdot v)v$

- **Meaning:** The projection of point $p$ onto a plane defined by orthonormal vectors $u$ and $v$ is the sum of its components along those axes.

- **Use in graphics:** Converting 3D world coordinates into 2D coordinates to display on a monitor.

## Practical Use

**Hierarchical Animation (Rigging)**

- Calculating the position of a robot's hand by chaining matrices: the hand moves relative to the elbow, which moves relative to the shoulder, which moves relative to the body.

**Camera Views**

- Using projection matrices to calculate exactly where the vertices of a 3D house model appear on a 2D screen based on the camera's angle.

**Optimization**

- Pre-calculating a single "Model-View-Projection" matrix so the GPU performs one multiplication per vertex instead of dozens of separate moves, rotations, and scales.
