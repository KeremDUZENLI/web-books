# Chapter 3.5: Dimension, Orthogonal Complements

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter introduces **dimension** as the number of vectors in a basis, which serves as a measure of a vector space's "size" or complexity.

- It also explores **orthogonal complements**, the set of all vectors perpendicular to a given subspace, which is crucial for decomposing spaces into independent parts.

- This matters for computer graphics because dimension tells us the number of parameters needed to control an object (degrees of freedom), and orthogonal complements are used in projections, shadows, and finding shortest distances.

## Keywords

**Dimension ($\dim V$):**

- The number of vectors in any basis of a vector space; it is an invariant property (all bases for the same space have the same number of vectors).

**Finite-Dimensional:**

- A vector space that can be spanned by a finite number of vectors (e.g., $\mathbb{R}^3$ has dimension 3).

**Orthogonal Complement ($W^\perp$):**

- The set of all vectors in a larger space $V$ that are orthogonal (perpendicular) to every vector in a subspace $W$.

**Row Space & Column Space:**

- Subspaces defined by the rows and columns of a matrix; the dimension of both is equal to the matrix's rank.

**Null Space:**

- The subspace of all solutions to $Ax=0$; its dimension is related to the rank by the Rank-Nullity Theorem.

## Formulas

**Rank-Nullity Theorem**

- **Formula:** $\text{rank}(A) + \dim(\text{Null}(A)) = n$ (where $A$ is $m \times n$)

- **Meaning:** The total number of variables ($n$) is split between the pivot variables (rank) and the free variables (nullity).

- **Use in graphics:** Determining if a system of constraints (like inverse kinematics) has a unique solution or allows for flexible movement.

**Orthogonal Decomposition**

- **Formula:** $V = W \oplus W^\perp$

- **Meaning:** Any vector $\mathbf{v}$ in space $V$ can be uniquely split into two parts: one part inside subspace $W$ and one part perpendicular to $W$.

- **Use in graphics:** Projecting a point onto a plane (finding the shadow) or decomposing velocity into tangential and normal components.

**Dimension of Orthogonal Complement**

- **Formula:** $\dim(W) + \dim(W^\perp) = \dim(V)$

- **Meaning:** The "sizes" of a subspace and its perpendicular space add up to the size of the total space.

- **Use in graphics:** Understanding the relationship between a plane (2D) and its normal vector (1D) in 3D space ($2+1=3$).

## Practical Use

**Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**

- The dimension of a configuration space represents the number of independent controls (DOF) an object has (e.g., a rigid body in 3D has 6 DOF: 3 position + 3 rotation).

**Shadow Mapping**

- Calculating shadows involves projecting geometry onto a subspace (the shadow plane) along a light direction, effectively utilizing orthogonal decomposition.

**Least Squares Fitting**

- Finding the best-fit line or plane for a cloud of points (e.g., for surface reconstruction) relies on minimizing the error vector, which must be in the orthogonal complement of the model space.

**Collision Response**

- When an object hits a wall, its velocity is split into a component parallel to the wall (friction/slide) and a component orthogonal to the wall (bounce), using orthogonal complements.
