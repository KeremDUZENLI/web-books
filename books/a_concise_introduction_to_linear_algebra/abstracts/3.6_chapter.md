# Chapter 3.6: Change of Basis

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter explains how to translate the coordinates of a vector from one reference system (basis) to another using an invertible transition matrix.

- It also demonstrates how the matrix representing a linear transformation changes when the underlying basis changes, introducing the concept of "similar matrices" which represent the same operation in different coordinate systems.

## Keywords

**Ordered Basis:**

- A basis where the order of vectors is fixed (e.g., $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$), allowing vectors to be represented by a unique list of coordinates.

**Coordinate Vector ($x_A$):**

- The specific column vector of numbers (coefficients) that represents a vector $x$ relative to a specific basis $A$.

**Transition Matrix ($S$):**

- The matrix that converts coordinates from one basis to another (e.g., from basis $B$ to basis $A$); its columns are the vectors of the "new" basis expressed in terms of the "old" basis.

**Similar Matrices:**

- Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are called similar if $B = S^{-1}AS$; this means they represent the exact same linear mapping, just viewed from different coordinate systems.

## Formulas

**Coordinate Conversion**

- **Formula:** $x_A = S x_B$

- **Meaning:** To get the coordinates in basis $A$, multiply the transition matrix $S$ by the coordinates in basis $B$.

- **Use in graphics:** Converting a vertex position from "Camera Space" coordinates back to "World Space" coordinates.

**Inverse Conversion**

- **Formula:** $x_B = S^{-1} x_A$

- **Meaning:** To go the other way (from $A$ to $B$), use the inverse of the transition matrix.

- **Use in graphics:** Converting world coordinates into local object coordinates for collision detection.

**Standard Basis Change**

- **Formula:** $x = B x_B \quad \text{and} \quad x_B = B^{-1} x$

- **Meaning:** If $A$ is the standard basis (Identity), the basis matrix $B$ itself acts as the transition matrix.

- **Use in graphics:** Mapping a texture from a standard square to a distorted polygon.

**Change of Matrix Representation (Similarity)**

- **Formula:** $M_B = S^{-1} M_A S$

- **Meaning:** The matrix for a transformation in the new basis ($M_B$) is obtained by "sandwiching" the old matrix ($M_A$) between the transition matrix and its inverse.

- **Use in graphics:** Rotating an object around an arbitrary axis by temporarily moving to a basis aligned with that axis.

## Practical Use

**Coordinate Systems**

- Changing bases allows developers to switch between "World Coordinates" (where everything is) and "View Coordinates" (what the camera sees).

**Simplifying Calculations**

- Some geometric operations are complex in the standard basis but very simple in a custom basis (e.g., a scaling operation might just be a diagonal matrix in the right basis).

**Robot Animation**

- Calculating the position of a robot's hand involves a chain of basis changes from the shoulder to the elbow to the wrist.
