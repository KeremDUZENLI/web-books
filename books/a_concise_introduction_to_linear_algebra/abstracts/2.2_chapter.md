# Chapter 2.2: The Theory of Gaussian Elimination

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter formalizes the outcome of Gaussian elimination by introducing the "echelon form" and the concept of "rank" to rigorously classify linear systems.

- It provides the theoretical rules for determining if a geometric problem (like finding intersections) has a single unique solution, an infinite range of solutions, or no solution at all.

## Keywords

**Echelon Form:**

- A "staircase" matrix structure where all zero rows are at the bottom and the leading entry of every row is to the right of the one above it, revealing the system's underlying structure.

**Rank:**

- The number of nonzero rows (or pivots) in the echelon form; it measures the number of truly independent constraints in the system.

**Consistent System:**

- A system of equations that has at least one valid solution, meaning the geometric objects described by the equations actually intersect.

**Free Variable:**

- A variable that does not correspond to a pivot column and can be assigned any arbitrary parameter value, creating infinite solutions (lines or planes).

## Formulas

**Unique Solution Condition**

- **Formula:** $r = n$

- **Meaning:** The rank equals the number of unknowns, meaning there are no free variables.

- **Use in graphics:** Confirming that a ray hits a triangle at exactly one specific point.

**Infinite Solutions Condition**

- **Formula:** $r < n$ (for a consistent system)

- **Meaning:** The rank is less than the number of unknowns, leaving $n - r$ parameters free.

- **Use in graphics:** Identifying that two planes intersect to form a line (1 degree of freedom) rather than a point.

**Inconsistency Condition**

- **Formula:** $0 = c$ (where $c \neq 0$)

- **Meaning:** The row reduction leads to a mathematical contradiction (e.g., $0 = 5$).

- **Use in graphics:** Determining that two parallel planes never intersect.

## Practical Use

**Intersection Classification**

- Distinguishing between cases where geometry touches at a point, overlaps along a line/surface, or misses completely.

**Matrix Singularity Checks**

- Using rank to check if a transformation matrix is "singular" (non-invertible), which happens if it squashes 3D space into a 2D plane or 1D line.

**Constraint Solving**

- Managing degrees of freedom in animation rigs; if the rank is lower than the number of joints, the system has flexibility (free variables) to move while satisfying constraints.
