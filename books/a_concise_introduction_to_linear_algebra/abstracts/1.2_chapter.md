# Chapter 1.2: Length and Dot Product of Vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$

---

## Main Idea

- This subchapter defines the Euclidean length (norm) of vectors and the dot product, establishing the fundamental concepts of distance, angles, and orthogonality in $n$-dimensional space.

- These concepts are critical in computer graphics for calculating lighting intensities (using angles), collision detection (using distances), and projecting geometry onto different axes.

## Keywords

**Length (Norm):**

- The straight-line distance from the origin to the point defined by the vector, derived from the Pythagorean theorem.

**Dot Product (Scalar Product):**

- An algebraic operation that multiplies corresponding components and sums them, resulting in a scalar value that relates to the angle between vectors.

**Orthogonality:**

- The condition where two vectors are perpendicular to each other, mathematically defined by their dot product being zero.

**Unit Vector:**

- A vector with a length of 1, often used to represent pure direction (like surface normals) without magnitude affecting calculations.

**Orthogonal Projection:**

- The "shadow" one vector casts onto another, decomposing a vector into parallel and perpendicular components.

## Formulas

**Vector Length**

- **Formula:** $|p| = \sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2 + \dots + p_n^2}$

- **Meaning:** Calculates the magnitude of vector $p$.

- **Use in graphics:** Normalizing vectors for lighting or checking object speeds.

**Distance Between Points**

- **Formula:** $|p - q| = \sqrt{\sum (p_i - q_i)^2}$

- **Meaning:** The length of the vector connecting points $P$ and $Q$.

- **Use in graphics:** Collision detection (checking if distance < radius).

**Dot Product (Algebraic)**

- **Formula:** $p \cdot q = p_1 q_1 + p_2 q_2 + \dots + p_n q_n$

- **Meaning:** The sum of the products of corresponding components.

- **Use in graphics:** Efficiently computing the angle relationship between vectors.

**Dot Product (Geometric)**

- **Formula:** $p \cdot q = |p| |q| \cos \theta$

- **Meaning:** Relates the algebraic dot product to the geometric angle $\theta$.

- **Use in graphics:** Calculating diffuse lighting (Lambert’s cosine law).

**Orthogonality Condition**

- **Formula:** $p \cdot q = 0$

- **Meaning:** Vectors $p$ and $q$ are perpendicular.

- **Use in graphics:** Culling backfaces or verifying perpendicular axes.

**Orthogonal Projection**

- **Formula:** $\text{proj}_q(p) = \frac{p \cdot q}{|q|^2} q$

- **Meaning:** The vector component of $p$ that lies along the line of $q$.

- **Use in graphics:** Shadow mapping or physics simulations (sliding along walls).

## Practical Use

**Lighting Calculations**

- Using the dot product of a light vector and a surface normal to determine how bright a pixel should be based on the angle of incidence.

**Physics Simulation (Work)**

- Calculating work done by a force as the dot product of the force vector and the displacement vector.

**Finding Angles**

- Determining the angle between arbitrary vectors in high-dimensional spaces using the inverse cosine of the normalized dot product.

**Decomposing Vectors**

- Breaking a vector (like velocity) into components parallel and perpendicular to a surface to simulate bouncing or sliding.
