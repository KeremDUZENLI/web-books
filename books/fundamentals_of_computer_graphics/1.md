## Main Idea

- This chapter defines **computer graphics** as the use of computers to create and manipulate images.

- It introduces the core algorithms and mathematical tools needed to produce synthetic images of three-dimensional objects and scenes.

- This foundation explains why mathematical rigor and programming efficiency are essential for building robust graphics programs.

## Keywords

**Modeling**

- The **mathematical specification of shape** and appearance properties. It defines the 3D data (like point sets and reflection rules) so it can be stored by the computer.

**Rendering**

- The process of **creating shaded images** directly from the mathematically defined 3D computer models. This is the image creation step.

**Graphics Pipeline**

- A specialized **software/hardware subsystem** optimized to efficiently draw 3D primitives in perspective. It is the machinery for processing and composing **4x4 matrices and 4-vectors**.

**Homogeneous Coordinate**

- A **fourth coordinate** added to traditional geometric coordinates ($x, y, z$). It helps handle perspective viewing and is considered the biggest intellectual hurdle when starting graphics.

## Formulas

**Transformation Matrix (4x4)**

- **Meaning:** A **square array of numbers** used to represent spatial transforms.

- **Use in graphics:** Used in the Graphics Pipeline to map 3D vertices to 2D screen positions and **efficiently combine rotation, scaling, and projection**.

**Linear Interpolation (Lerp)**

- **Formula:** $(1 - t)\mathbf{A} + t\mathbf{B}$

- **Meaning:** Blending between two data items $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ using parameter $t$.

- **Use in graphics:** Arguably the **most common mathematical operation** in graphics, used ubiquitously for property blending.

## Practical Use

**Code Design/Strategy**

- Using **good classes** for geometric entities like vectors and matrices is a key part of graphics programming. This approach, called the **KISS ("keep it simple, stupid") principle**, creates smaller, more robust programs.

**Efficiency/Optimization**

- Optimizing **memory access patterns** (locality) is often more important for performance than just minimizing the count of mathematical operations. Minimizing the number of triangles used, possibly through varying **Level of Detail (LOD)**, is useful for speed, especially for interactivity.

**Numerical Precision**

- It is suggested to use **double-precision numbers (doubles)** for precise geometric computation, while **single-precision (floats)** are suitable for storing large datasets, like triangle meshes, due to memory concerns.

**Rendering Pipeline**

- The process of displaying objects in the correct back-to-front order is nearly always solved using the **z-buffer** (depth buffer).

## Questions

- Why does the graphics pipeline require 4D coordinates, and what is the function of the fourth coordinate?
