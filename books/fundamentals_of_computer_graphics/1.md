# Core Concepts (Fundamental Definitions)

Computer graphics describes any use of computers to create and manipulate images, particularly focusing on generating synthetic images of three-dimensional objects and scenes.

- **Modeling:** This area involves the mathematical specification of shape and appearance properties (such as 3D point sets, reflection models, and interpolation rules) so that they can be stored and represented within the computer.
- **Rendering:** This process creates shaded images directly from the mathematically defined 3D computer models.
- **Animation:** This technique uses modeling and rendering to create sequences of images that produce the illusion of movement over time, dealing explicitly with the issue of time and motion.
- **The Graphics Pipeline:** This is a specialized software and hardware subsystem, prevalent in modern desktop computers, designed to efficiently draw 3D primitives in perspective. Graphics APIs (Application Program Interfaces) are used to interact with this pipeline.

# Essential Practical Components (Implementation and Efficiency)

Successful graphics programming emphasizes numerical robustness and maximizing computational efficiency, especially regarding memory utilization.

- **Efficiency Heuristic:** Programmers should prioritize optimizing **memory access patterns** (locality) over minimizing the simple count of mathematical operations, as memory speed advances slower than processor speed.
  - Code should first be written straightforwardly; optimization should only occur after profiling tools pinpoint the true bottlenecks.
- **Numerical Precision:** The widely adopted **IEEE floating-point standard** governs how real numbers and special values (such as $\infty$, $-\infty$, and $\text{NaN}$) are handled, allowing programmers to make convenient assumptions about numerical conditions.
  - It is generally recommended to use **double-precision floating-point numbers (doubles)** for precise geometric calculations, such as positions and distances.
  - **Single-precision numbers (floats)** are suitable for storing large datasets like triangle meshes and color data, where memory consumption is a concern.
- **Core Data Structures:** Essential classes for organizing a graphics program include `vector2`, `vector3`, `hvector` (homogeneous vector), `rgb` (color), `transform` ($4 \times 4$ matrix), and `image`. Keeping geometric locations (points) and displacements (vectors) conceptually separate can make code more readable.

# Key Formulas & Geometric/Practical Interpretation

A central element of the Graphics Pipeline is the use of 4D coordinates, which constitutes the **biggest intellectual hurdle** when learning computer graphics.

# Formula: Transformation via Homogeneous Coordinates

All fundamental transformations (translation, rotation, scaling, and projection) in the graphics pipeline are unified and applied using $4 \times 4$ matrices ($\mathbf{M}$) operating on 4-vectors ($\mathbf{p}$), referred to as Homogeneous Coordinates:

$$
\mathbf{p}' = \mathbf{M} \mathbf{p}
$$

- **Interpretation (4D System):** The 4D coordinate system includes three traditional geometric coordinates and a fourth **homogeneous coordinate ($w$)**. This system allows complex, typically non-linear perspective viewing to be processed using standard matrix multiplication.
- **Practical Function (Positions vs. Directions):** The $w$ coordinate is used to distinguish between different geometric entities, a critical concept in handling affine transformations:
  - A **Position** (Location) is typically represented with $w=1$ (e.g., $[x, y, z, 1]^T$).
  - A **Direction** (Displacement) is represented with $w=0$ (e.g., $[x, y, z, 0]^T$).
  - This distinction ensures that direction vectors are properly rotated and scaled by $\mathbf{M}$ but **are deliberately immune to translation**.
