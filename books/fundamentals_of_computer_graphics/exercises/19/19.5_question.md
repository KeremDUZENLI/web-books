5. With results from Exercise 4, we can approximate a simple Pong game:

   - The paddles are rectangles;
   - A pong-ball is drawn as a circle but we will use the bounding square (a square that centers at the center of the circle, with dimension defined by the diameter of the circle) to approximate collision with the paddle.

   Design and implement a single-player pong-game where a ball (circle) drops under gravitational force and the user must manipulate a paddle to bounce the ball upward to prevent it from dropping below the application window. You should:

   (a) design a specification (similar to that of Section 19.1) for this pong game;

   (b) follow the steps outlined in Section 19.2.3 to design an event-driven programming solution;

   (c) implement your design either with OpenGL or Direct-3D.
