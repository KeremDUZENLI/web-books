- **Goal:** Find the total radiance $L$ in a closed room where walls have emission $E$ and reflectance $R$.

- **Equation:** The light leaving a surface ($L$) is the emitted light plus reflected light. Since the room is closed and uniform, the incident light coming _in_ is the same as the light going _out_ ($L$).

  $$
  L = E + R \cdot L
  $$

- **Solve for $L$:**

  $$
  L - R \cdot L = E \implies L(1 - R) = E \implies L = \frac{E}{1 - R}
  $$

- **Calculation:**

  $$
  L = \frac{0.25}{1 - 0.5} = \frac{0.25}{0.5} = 0.5
  $$
