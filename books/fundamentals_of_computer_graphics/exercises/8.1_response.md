- **Scenario:** A triangle has one vertex in front of the camera ($z < 0$, e.g., $z = -2$) and one behind the camera ($z > 0$, e.g., $z = 0.5$).

- **The Reversal:** The perspective projection involves dividing by $w$ (which is typically $-z$ for a camera looking down the negative $z$-axis).

  - For the front vertex: $w = -(-2) = 2$. Division is by a positive number.

  - For the back vertex: $w = -(0.5) = -0.5$. Division is by a negative number.

- **Consequence:** The vertex behind the camera is projected to the screen, but its coordinates are negated ($x/-0.5, y/-0.5$). It appears "upside down" and "reversed" relative to the rest of the geometry. Additionally, the triangle mathematically passes through the singularity at $z=0$ (the eye), effectively wrapping around the universe.

- **Conclusion:** This is why clipping must happen in homogeneous coordinates **before** the divide; once you divide, you cannot mathematically distinguish between a point "correctly" projected from in front of you and a point "incorrectly" projected from behind you.
