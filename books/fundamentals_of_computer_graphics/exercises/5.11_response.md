- **Formula:**

  $$
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}
  \begin{vmatrix}
  x_0 & x_1 & x_2 \\
  y_0 & y_1 & y_2 \\
  1 & 1 & 1
  \end{vmatrix}
  $$

- **Explanation:** This 3x3 determinant effectively computes the cross product of the vectors $(P_1 - P_0)$ and $(P_2 - P_0)$ in 2D.

  1. The column of 1s handles the "translation" to the origin implicitly.

  2. The result is twice the area of the triangle formed by the points.

  3. The $1/2$ factor corrects this to the triangle area .
