- **Assumptions:** $N$ is the number of objects, $P$ is the number of pixels (rays). "Nice" models imply a balanced spatial distribution allowing efficient acceleration structures.

- **Preprocessing (Static Model):**

  - Building an acceleration structure (like a BVH or BSP tree) typically takes **$O(N \log N)$**. This is done once per scene.

- **Image Computation (Per Frame):**

  - **Brute Force:** Testing every ray against every object takes **$O(P \cdot N)$**.

  - **With Acceleration:** Traversing a balanced tree structure takes logarithmic time per ray, resulting in **$O(P \log N)$**.

- **Conclusion:** For static models, the heavy $O(N \log N)$ build cost is amortized over many frames, making the per-frame cost dependent primarily on resolution and scene complexity logarithmically .
