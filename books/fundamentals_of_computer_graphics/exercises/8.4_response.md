- **Tie-Breaker Rule:**

  $$
  \text{Draw if } (f(x, y) > 0) \textbf{ OR } (f(x, y) == 0 \textbf{ AND } f(-1, -1) > 0)
  $$

- **Explanation:**

  - $f(x, y)$ is the edge function for the triangle edge.

  - If the pixel center is exactly on the edge ($f=0$), we check the sign of an arbitrary off-screen point, like $(-1, -1)$.

  - Since $(-1, -1)$ is never on a visible edge, it serves as a consistent global reference. If the triangle is on the "same side" of the line as $(-1, -1)$, it claims the pixel. If it is on the opposite side, it yields the pixel to the neighbor. This ensures every pixel on a shared edge is drawn exactly once.
