- **Given:** A square matrix $\mathbf{M}$ with orthonormal columns. This means $\mathbf{M}^T \mathbf{M} = \mathbf{I}$.

- **Step 1:** Since the matrix is square and $\mathbf{M}^T$ is its left inverse, it must also be the right inverse: $\mathbf{M} \mathbf{M}^T = \mathbf{I}$.

- **Step 2:** The entry $(i, j)$ of $\mathbf{M} \mathbf{M}^T$ is the dot product of **row** $i$ and **row** $j$ of $\mathbf{M}$.

- **Result:** Since the result is the identity matrix, the dot product of a row with itself is 1 (normalized) and with any other row is 0 (orthogonal). Thus, the rows are orthonormal.
