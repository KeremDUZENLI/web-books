- **Goal:** Estimate the complexity of drawing an isosurface in a grid of size $n \times n \times n$ ($n^3$ voxels).

- **Dimensional Analysis:**

  - The volume itself consists of $n^3$ cells (3D).

  - An isosurface is a **2D surface** (a manifold) cutting through that volume.

  - Ideally, a surface scales with area ($n^2$), not volume ($n^3$).

- **Reasoning:** Imagine a plane cutting through a cube of $n^3$ blocks. It touches roughly $n \times n$ blocks.

- **Result:** Approximately **$O(n^2)$** cells will contain the isosurface. This explains why optimizing algorithms to skip empty space (reducing complexity from $n^3$ to $n^2$) is so critical for performance.
