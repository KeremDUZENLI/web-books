- **Idea:** Two segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect if and only if $A$ and $B$ lie on opposite sides of the line through $CD$, **AND** $C$ and $D$ lie on opposite sides of the line through $AB$.

- **Procedure:**

  1.  Create the implicit line equation for $CD$: $f_{cd}(p) = 0$.

  2.  Check signs: If $f_{cd}(A) \cdot f_{cd}(B) > 0$, they are on the same side (no intersection).

  3.  Repeat for line $AB$ against points $C$ and $D$.

  4.  If both tests show opposite signs, they intersect.
