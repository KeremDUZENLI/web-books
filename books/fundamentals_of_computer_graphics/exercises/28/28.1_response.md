- **Goal:** Determine the number of lookup cases for the "Marching Tetrahedra" algorithm (similar to Marching Cubes).

- **Setup:** A tetrahedron has **4 vertices**.

- **Binary State:** Each vertex can be either "inside" or "outside" the isosurface (0 or 1).

- **Calculation:** The total number of permutations is $2^{\text{vertices}} = 2^4 = 16$.

- **Result:** There are **16 cases**.

  - _Note:_ By applying symmetry (inverting inside/outside), this can be reduced to just 3 unique topological cases:

    1.  All out/in (No geometry).

    2.  One in/out (Cut off one corner $\to$ 1 Triangle).

    3.  Two in/two out (Cut through middle $\to$ 1 Quad/2 Triangles).
