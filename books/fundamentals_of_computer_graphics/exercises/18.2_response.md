- **Concept:** Triangle strips reduce data volume by reusing the last two vertices for the next triangle.

- **Hardware Reality:** GPUs have a **Post-Transform Vertex Cache** (usually storing the last 16–32 processed vertices).

- **Optimization:**

  - If a strip is very long and "wanders" around a mesh, it might require a vertex that was processed 50 steps ago. If the cache is small, that vertex has fallen out of the cache and must be recalculated (transform + lighting).

  - **Optimal Size:** There is a "sweet spot" for strip length. Strips should be long enough to minimize bus traffic (sending indices) but spatially localized enough to ensure reused vertices are still in the cache.

- **Conclusion:** If performance drops with extremely long strips, it indicates you are thrashing the **vertex cache** on the graphics hardware.
