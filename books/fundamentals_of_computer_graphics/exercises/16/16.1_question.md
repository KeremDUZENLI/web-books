1. In an implicit surface modeling system the fall-off filter function is defined as

   $$
   f(r) =
   \begin{cases}
   0 & r > R \\
   1 - r/R & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}
   $$

   where $R$ is a constant. A point primitive placed at $(-1, 0)$ and another at $(1, 0)$ are rendered to show the $f = 0.5$ iso-surface. The value $R$, the distance where the potential due to the point falls to zero in both cases, is 1.5.

   Calculate the potential at the point $(0, 0)$ and at $+0.5$ intervals until the point $(2.5, 0)$. Sketch the 0.5 contour and the contour at which the field falls to zero.
