- **Formula:** $\log_b(x) = \frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(b)}$

- **Negative $b$:** The function should return **NaN** (Not a Number).

- **Explanation:** You can calculate a log of any base by dividing the natural log of the value by the natural log of the base. Logarithms are undefined for negative bases in real number arithmetic.
