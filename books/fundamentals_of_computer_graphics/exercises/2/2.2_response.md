- **Part A (Can it be implemented?):** Yes.

- **Part B (Do all have inverses?):** No.

- **Explanation:** You can map every 32-bit integer to a unique 64-bit integer (e.g., just copying the value), so a well-defined inverse exists for _those specific values_. However, not _all_ functions from 32-bit to 64-bit are invertible (many 64-bit numbers have no 32-bit counterpart), and many functions mapping the other way (64 to 32) lose data.
