4. For the rectangle in Exercise 3:

   (a) Support the definition of a velocity similar to that of HeroBall velocity in Section 19.1: once created, the rectangle will travel along a direction that is the vector defined from its center towards the LMB release position.

   (b) Design and implement collision between two rectangles (this is a simple 2D bound intersection check).
