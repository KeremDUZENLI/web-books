- **Matrix:** A diagonal matrix $\mathbf{D}$ has entries $d_{ii}$ on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere.

- **Eigenvector Equation:** $\mathbf{D}\mathbf{x} = \lambda\mathbf{x}$.

- **Observation:** If we multiply $\mathbf{D}$ by a standard basis vector $\mathbf{e}_i$ (a vector with 1 at index $i$), the result is $d_{ii} \mathbf{e}_i$.

- **Result:** The vector direction didn't change, only scaled by $d_{ii}$. Therefore, the diagonal entries are the eigenvalues .
