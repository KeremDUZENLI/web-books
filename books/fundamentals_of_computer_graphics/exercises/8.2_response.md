- **Problem:** If you clip after the perspective divide (in screen space), you lose the sign of $w$.

- **Example:** A point at $(0, 0, 1)$ (behind the camera) projects to $(0, 0)$ on screen (center). A point at $(0, 0, -5)$ (in front) also projects to $(0, 0)$.

- **Result:** In 2D screen space, both points look identical. If you only clip against the screen boundaries (e.g., $x \in [-1, 1]$), the point behind the camera is erroneously accepted and drawn on top of the visible scene. You must clip against the near plane ($z = n$) in 3D/4D space to properly reject the geometry behind the lens.
