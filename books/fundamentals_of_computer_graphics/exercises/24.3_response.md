- **Goal:** Estimate the number of particles needed for a "typically-sized room."

- **Assumptions:**

  - Room dimensions: $5m \times 5m \times 3m$ (roughly bedroom size).

  - Surface Area ($A$): $2(5 \times 5) + 2(5 \times 3) + 2(5 \times 3) = 50 + 30 + 30 = 110 \text{ m}^2$.

  - Resolution: $1 \text{ cm}^2$ texels $\rightarrow 100 \times 100 = 10,000 \text{ texels/m}^2$.

  - Total Texels: $110 \times 10,000 = 1,100,000 \text{ texels}$.

  - Requirement: 1000 hits per texel.

- **Calculation:**

  $$
  \text{Total Particles} = 1,100,000 \times 1000 = 1.1 \text{ billion particles}
  $$

- **Result:** Approximately **1 billion particles** are needed for high-quality, noise-free texture baking in a standard room.
