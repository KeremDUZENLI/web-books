- **Goal:** Decide if calculating shadows is worth the cost in Direct Volume Rendering (DVR).

- **Argument For (Yes):**

  - **Depth Cues:** Without shadows, semi-transparent clouds look "flat" or muddy. Shadows provide essential cues about the relative position and density of features (e.g., a dense bone casting a shadow on tissue).

  - **Shape Perception:** Volumetric self-shadowing helps define the 3D shape of the data.

- **Argument Against (No):**

  - **Performance:** Calculating shadows requires sending a secondary ray toward the light for _every step_ along the viewing ray. This can double or triple the rendering cost.

- **Conclusion:** Yes, if visual clarity and depth perception are important; No, if raw interactive speed is the priority.
