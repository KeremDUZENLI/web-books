- **Goal:** Explain why 20W fluorescent is "brighter" or preferred over 20W incandescent.

- **Concept:** **Luminous Efficiency**.

  - **Incandescent:** Converts most of the 20 Watts into **heat** (infrared radiation). The human eye cannot see infrared, so this energy is "wasted" in terms of visibility.

  - **Fluorescent:** Converts the 20 Watts primarily into **visible light** wavelengths where the eye's sensitivity function $V(\lambda)$ is high.

- **Result:** While both consume the same _electrical_ power (Radiometric watts), the fluorescent bulb produces far more **lumens** (Photometric power), making it visually brighter and more efficient for lighting.
