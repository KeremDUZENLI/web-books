4. A quintic: (a degree five polynomial, so the matrices will be 6×6) where $\mathbf{p}_0$ is the beginning position, $\mathbf{p}_1$ is the beginning derivative, $\mathbf{p}_2$ is the middle ($u = 0.5$) position, $\mathbf{p}_3$ is the first derivative at the middle, $\mathbf{p}_4$ is the position at the end, and $\mathbf{p}_5$ is the first derivative at the end.
