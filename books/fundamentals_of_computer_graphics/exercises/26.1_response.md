- **Goal:** Compare the graphics requirements of two dissimilar genres, for example, a **First-Person Shooter (FPS)** (e.g., _Crysis_) versus a **Real-Time Strategy (RTS)** (e.g., _Command & Conquer_).

- **Game A: First-Person Shooter (FPS)**

  - **Visual Goal:** Photorealism and immersion.

  - **Rendering Time:** The camera gets very close to objects. The budget is spent heavily on **Pixel Shaders** (per-pixel lighting, normal mapping) and post-processing effects (motion blur, depth of field). Target is often 60 FPS for low latency.

  - **Storage:** High budget for **Texture Memory**. Every surface needs high-resolution diffuse, specular, and normal maps because the player can inspect them up close.

  - **Geometry:** High polygon counts for foreground characters (hero assets).

- **Game B: Real-Time Strategy (RTS)**

  - **Visual Goal:** Clarity and scale (seeing the battlefield).

  - **Rendering Time:** The camera is distant and high up. The budget is spent on handling **Vertex Processing** for hundreds of units onscreen simultaneously. Pixel shaders can be simpler since fine detail is not visible.

  - **Storage:** Lower texture resolution per unit is acceptable. However, memory is needed to store the **game state** and logic for hundreds of active entities.

  - **Geometry:** Lower polygon counts per unit (LODs), but a massive number of draw calls.

- **Conclusion:** The FPS is bound by **Fill Rate** (drawing pixels) and Texture Bandwidth, while the RTS is often bound by **CPU** (unit logic) or **Vertex Processing** (transforming many small objects).
