- **Observation:** When you look at a full moon, it appears as a flat, uniformly bright disk. It does not look like a lit sphere, which would normally appear brighter in the center and darker at the edges (limb darkening) due to the Lambertian cosine law ($\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{l}$).

- **Reason:** The moon's surface is covered in dust (regolith) that acts as a **retro-reflector**. It reflects light primarily back toward the source (the sun). Since the sun is behind the Earth (the viewer) during a full moon, the edges reflect just as much light back to us as the center. Standard diffuse/Phong shading cannot capture this "flat" look.
