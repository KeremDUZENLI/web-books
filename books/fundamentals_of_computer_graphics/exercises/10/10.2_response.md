- **Observation:** Velvet fabric often appears brightest at the edges (grazing angles) where the material curves away from the viewer, and darker in the regions facing the viewer directly. This is the opposite of standard diffuse shading.

- **Reason:** Velvet is made of tiny fibers standing up.

  - When looking directly at the surface (normal incidence), light gets trapped deep between the fibers (darker).

  - When looking at a glancing angle (grazing incidence), you see the sides of the fibers reflecting light brightly.

- **Conclusion:** Standard Phong shading places highlights based on surface normals, but velvet requires a model that accounts for **micro-geometry** and grazing scattering (often called "rim lighting" or "sheen").
