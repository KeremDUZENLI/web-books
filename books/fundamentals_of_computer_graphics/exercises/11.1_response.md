- **Goal:** Create a checkerboard pattern that covers a plane without seams or distortion.

- **Methods:**

  1.  **Surface Texture (Image):** Map a repeating 2D image of a checkerboard. _Pros:_ Fast. _Cons:_ Requires good UV mapping; repetition can look tiled/artificial if not handled well; magnifying close-ups reveals pixelation.

  2.  **Surface Texture (Procedural):** Compute color based on UVs: `(floor(u) + floor(v)) % 2`. _Pros:_ Infinite resolution; no memory usage. _Cons:_ Still requires UV mapping; prone to aliasing at distance.

  3.  **Solid Texture (Procedural):** Compute color based on 3D position: `(floor(x) + floor(y) + floor(z)) % 2`. _Pros:_ No UV mapping required; continuous across complex geometry. _Cons:_ Texture "swims" if the object moves (unless coordinates are transformed with the object).

- **Which is Best?**

  For an infinite plane, **Procedural Surface Texture** is usually best because it avoids storage limits (infinite resolution) and stays fixed to the surface. For complex objects, **Solid Texturing** is often preferred to avoid UV distortion artifacts.
