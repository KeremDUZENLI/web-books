- **Goal:** Find the Radiant Exitance ($E$) of a diffuse surface given its Radiance ($L$).

- **Definitions:**

  - **Radiance ($L$):** Power per unit projected area per solid angle. For a diffuse (Lambertian) surface, $L$ is constant in all directions.

  - **Radiant Exitance ($E$):** Total power leaving a unit area (integrated over the hemisphere).

- **Formula:**

  $$
  E = \int_{\Omega} L \cos \theta \, d\omega
  $$

  Since $L$ is constant, it moves out of the integral. The integral of $\cos \theta$ over the hemisphere is exactly $\pi$.

- **Result:** $E = \pi L$.
