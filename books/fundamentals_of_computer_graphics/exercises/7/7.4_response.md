- **Goal:** Show that if $z_1 < z_2$, then transformed depth $z'_1 < z'_2$ (monotonicity).

- **Formula:** The projected depth $z'$ is derived from the perspective matrix row constants $A$ and $B$:
  $$z' = \frac{Az + B}{z} = A + \frac{B}{z}$$

- **Derivative:** Taking the derivative with respect to $z$:
  $$\frac{d}{dz} (A + B z^{-1}) = -\frac{B}{z^2}$$

- **Analysis:** Since $z^2$ is always positive, the sign of the derivative depends entirely on $-B$. Since $B = -fn$ (which is non-zero), the slope never changes sign.

- **Result:** The function is monotonic, meaning it never reverses direction, so the relative order of depth is preserved.
