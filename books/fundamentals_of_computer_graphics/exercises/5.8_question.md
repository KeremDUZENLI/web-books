8.  Demonstrate the four interpretations of matrix-matrix multiplication by taking the following matrix-matrix multiplication code, rearranging the nested loops, and interpreting the resulting code in terms of matrix and vector operations.

    ```text
    function mat-mult(in a[m][p], in b[p][n], out c[m][n]) {
       // the array c is initialized to zero
       for i = 1 to m
          for j = 1 to n
             for k = 1 to p
                c[i][j] += a[i][k] * b[k][j]
    }
    ```
