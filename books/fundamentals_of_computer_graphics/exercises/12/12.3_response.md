- **Concept:** Tiling decomposes an $n$-dimensional array into small blocks (tiles) to improve memory cache locality.

- **Indexing:** To find an element in a tiled array, you calculate an offset based on the coordinates.

- **Formula:** For a 3D array, the index is $F_x(x) + F_y(y) + F_z(z)$.

- **Result:** You need **$n$** look-up tables (one for each dimension) to store the pre-computed offset values ($F$). This avoids expensive division and modulus operations inside the inner loops.
