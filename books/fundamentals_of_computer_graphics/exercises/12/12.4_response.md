- **Minimum:** **$N$**.

  - If the scene geometry is arranged such that no triangle plane intersects any other triangle (e.g., all triangles are parallel or widely separated), no splitting occurs. Every triangle becomes a node exactly once.

- **Maximum:** **$O(N^2)$**.

  - In the worst-case scenario (a "soup" of intersecting triangles or a spiral arrangement), adding a triangle can split it against the planes of all previously added triangles. Each split increases the total count. While heuristics prevent this in practice, the theoretical upper bound for auto-partitioning space is quadratic.
