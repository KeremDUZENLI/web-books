- **Scenario:** A tetrahedron has 4 vertices and 4 triangular faces. It has 6 edges.

- **Independent Triangles:**

  - Stores 3 vertices per triangle.

  - Total: $4 \text{ triangles} \times 3 \text{ vertices} = 12 \text{ vector3s}$.

  - _No connectivity data stored._

- **Winged-Edge Structure:**

  - **Geometry:** Stores unique vertices only. Total: **4 vector3s**.

  - **Topology (Pointers/Indices):**

    - **Edges:** 6 edges. Each stores 8 references (head, tail, leftFace, rightFace, lPrev, lNext, rPrev, rNext). Total: $6 \times 8 = 48$.

    - **Vertices:** 4 vertices. Each stores 1 edge reference. Total: 4.

    - **Faces:** 4 faces. Each stores 1 edge reference. Total: 4.

  - **Total Topology:** 56 integers/pointers.

- **Comparison:** Independent triangles store 12 full geometric vectors. Winged-edge stores only 4 geometric vectors but adds the overhead of 56 pointers. For such a small mesh, winged-edge uses more memory; for large meshes, sharing vertices saves geometry space, but the connectivity overhead remains significant.
