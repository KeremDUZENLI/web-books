- **Problem:** In the marching cubes algorithm (or similar polygonizers), a cell might have vertex values that do not uniquely define the surface topology (e.g., alternating signs on a face).

- **Sampling Perspective:** This is fundamentally a violation of the **Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem**. The grid resolution (sampling rate) is too low to resolve the high-frequency features of the implicit function (such as a thin tunnel or two close surfaces). Because the grid "misses" the detail in between vertices, the reconstruction is ambiguous.
