- **Context:** This refers to the "mean chord length" of random lines passing through a shape (based on the "fair" measure of lines discussed in the chapter).

- **Formula:** For a 2D convex shape with Area $A$ and Perimeter $L$, the mean chord length is $\frac{\pi A}{L}$.

- **Values:**

  - Unit Square Area $A = 1 \times 1 = 1$.

  - Unit Square Perimeter $L = 1+1+1+1 = 4$.

- **Calculation:** $\bar{L} = \frac{\pi (1)}{4}$.

- **Result:** $\frac{\pi}{4} \approx 0.785$.
