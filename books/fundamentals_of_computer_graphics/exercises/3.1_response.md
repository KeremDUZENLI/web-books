- **Goal:** Understand how digital cameras capture color using a single sensor and how software fills in the gaps.

- **Procedure:**
  1.  **Mosaic Step (Simulating Raw Input):**
      - Create a new "sensor" image where each pixel only keeps **one** color channel based on the Bayer pattern (typically a $2 \times 2$ grid: Green/Red on top, Blue/Green on bottom).

```
 - *Example logic:*
   - If row is even and column is even: Keep **Green**.
   - If row is even and column is odd: Keep **Red**.
   - If row is odd and column is even: Keep **Blue**.
   - If row is odd and column is odd: Keep **Green**.
```

2.  **Reconstruction Step (Demosaicking):**

    - Create a new blank RGB image.

    - For every pixel, fill in the missing colors by averaging the available neighbors (Bilinear Interpolation).

    - _Example:_ If you are at a **Blue** pixel and need **Green**, average the four surrounding Green pixels (up, down, left, right). If you need **Red**, average the four diagonal Red pixels.
