- **Plastic (Dielectric):**

  - Plastic is composed of a clear, smooth outer surface and colored subsurface pigments.

  - The highlight is a reflection off the **clear outer surface**. It follows the Fresnel equations for dielectrics, which reflect a portion of the incoming light exactly as it is. If the light source is white, the reflection (highlight) is white.

- **Gold (Metal/Conductor):**

  - Metals do not have a subsurface layer; light does not penetrate them.

  - The reflection occurs due to interaction with the free electrons on the surface. This interaction absorbs specific wavelengths.

  - Therefore, the **specular reflection itself is colored** by the material properties. Gold reflects yellow wavelengths efficiently but absorbs blues, making the highlight appear gold.
