- **Concept:** A line segment in 3D is defined parametrically as $q(t) = A + t(B-A)$.

- **Transformation:**
  When we apply the perspective transform, the new parameter $t'$ in screen space is related to the original $t$ by a rational linear function of the form:
  $$t' = \frac{at + b}{ct + d}$$

- **Logic:**

  1. Projective transformations map lines to lines (straight lines do not become curved).

  2. We must ensure the segment doesn't "loop" or break.

  3. Since the $w$ coordinate (depth) does not change sign inside the view frustum (the denominator $ct+d$ is never zero), the function is continuous and monotonic.

- **Result:** The start point maps to the start, the end to the end, and all intermediate points map sequentially between them.
