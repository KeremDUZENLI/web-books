- **Given:**

  - Surface Area $A = 4 \text{ m}^2$.

  - Radiance $L$ (Diffuse).

- **Step 1 (Find Exitance):** From Exercise 1, we know the flux density leaving the surface is $E = \pi L$.

- **Step 2 (Find Power):** Power (Flux, $\Phi$) is Exitance multiplied by Area.

  $$
  \Phi = E \cdot A = (\pi L) \cdot 4
  $$

- **Result:** $\Phi = 4\pi L$ Watts.
