- **a) Velocity:**

  - Same as Exercise 2: $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{p}_{release} - \mathbf{p}_{center}$.

- **b) Collision (AABB Intersection):**

  - Two axis-aligned rectangles $R1$ and $R2$ intersect if and only if they overlap on **both** the X and Y axes.

  - **Test:**

    $$
    \text{Overlap}_X = (R1_{minX} < R2_{maxX}) \textbf{ AND } (R1_{maxX} > R2_{minX})
    $$

    $$
    \text{Overlap}_Y = (R1_{minY} < R2_{maxY}) \textbf{ AND } (R1_{maxY} > R2_{minY})
    $$

  - If $(\text{Overlap}_X \textbf{ AND } \text{Overlap}_Y)$ is true, they collide.
