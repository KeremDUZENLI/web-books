- **Answer:** Finite.

- **Explanation:** In pure mathematics, the set of real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$) is infinite (uncountable). However, under the IEEE floating-point standard, there is a fixed number of bits (usually 32 or 64). Because there is a limited number of bit combinations, the set of representable floats is **finite**.
