5. Suppose you are designing an integer z-buffer for flight simulation where all of the objects are at least one meter thick, are never closer to the viewer than 4 meters, and may be as far away as 100 km. How many bits are needed in the z-buffer to ensure there are no visibility errors? Suppose that visibility errors only matter near the viewer, i.e., for distances less than 100 meters. How many bits are needed in that case?
