- **Issue:** If $B^2$ is very close to $4AC$, then $\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC} \approx |B|$. If we incorrectly subtract two numbers that are almost identical (e.g., $-B + \sqrt{\dots}$ when $B$ is positive), the computer loses precision ("catastrophic cancellation").

- **Fix:** Use the standard formula to compute the root that involves **addition** (same sign), then use the identity $x_1 x_2 = C/A$ to find the second root safely .
