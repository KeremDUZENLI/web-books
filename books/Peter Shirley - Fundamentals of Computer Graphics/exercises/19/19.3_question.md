3. Here is the specification for dragging out a rectangle:

   - LMB click defines the center of the rectangle.
   - LMB drag out a rectangle such that the rectangle extends from the center position and one of the corner positions of the rectangle always follows the current mouse position.
   - RMB click-drag moves the rectangle such that the center of the rectangle follows the current mouse position.

   (a) Follow the steps outlined in Section 19.2.3 and design an event-driven programming solution for this specification.

   (b) Implement your design with FLTK and OpenGL.

   (c) Implement your design with MFC and Direct-3D.
