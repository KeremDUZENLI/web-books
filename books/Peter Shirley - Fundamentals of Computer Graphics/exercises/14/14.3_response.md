- **Goal:** Map two uniform random numbers $(\xi_1, \xi_2)$ to barycentric coordinates.

- **Derivation for $\beta$:**

  - The probability of picking a point with coordinate $\beta < b$ is proportional to the area of the triangle defined by that cutoff.

  - The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) is $P(\beta) = 1 - (1-\beta)^2$.

  - To sample, set $\xi_1 = P(\beta)$ and solve for $\beta$:

    $$
    \xi_1 = 1 - (1-\beta)^2 \implies (1-\beta)^2 = 1 - \xi_1 \implies \beta = 1 - \sqrt{1 - \xi_1}
    $$

- **Derivation for $\gamma$:**

  - Once $\beta$ is chosen, $\gamma$ must be chosen uniformly along the remaining segment length $(1 - \beta)$.

  - Result: $\gamma = \xi_2 (1 - \beta)$.

- **Note:** The text refers to $(1-u)$, which corresponds to the remaining length fraction.
