1. Simulate an image acquired from the Bayer mosaic by taking a natural image (preferably a scanned photo rather than a digital photo where the Bayer mosaic may already have been applied) and creating a grayscale image composed of interleaved red/green/blue channels. This simulates the raw output of a digital camera. Now create a true RGB image from that output and compare with the original.
