- **Theoretical Comparison:**

  - **CPU:** Designed for serial tasks, complex logic, and branching. Has fewer, powerful cores.

  - **GPU:** Designed for **SIMD** (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) tasks. It acts as a stream processor with many simpler cores, allowing it to process thousands of vertices or pixels simultaneously.

- **Experiment Expectation:**

  - **Small Data:** The CPU might be faster because the overhead of sending data across the bus (PCI-E) to the GPU takes longer than the actual math.

  - **Large Data:** The GPU will vastly outperform the CPU. As you move the workload (e.g., particle physics) from the CPU to a **Vertex Shader**, the framerate should increase significantly because the GPU processes the geometry in parallel and avoids sending update data across the bus every frame.

- **Result:** Performance improves massively on the GPU once the computational workload outweighs the data transfer overhead.
