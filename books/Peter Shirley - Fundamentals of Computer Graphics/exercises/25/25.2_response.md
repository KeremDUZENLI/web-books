- **Problem:** The BRDF $\rho = C \cos^a \theta_i$ is not reciprocal because swapping $\theta_i$ and $\theta_o$ changes the value (unless $a=0$).

- **Fix:** Symmetrize the expression so that $\theta_i$ and $\theta_o$ play identical roles. A common modification (similar to the Minnaert model) is to multiply by the cosine of the outgoing angle as well.

- **Modified BRDF:**

  $$
  \rho(\theta_i, \theta_o) = C (\cos \theta_i \cos \theta_o)^a
  $$

  Alternatively, just $C \cos^a \theta_i \cos^a \theta_o$

- **Result:** This function is unchanged if $\theta_i$ and $\theta_o$ are swapped, satisfying reciprocity.
