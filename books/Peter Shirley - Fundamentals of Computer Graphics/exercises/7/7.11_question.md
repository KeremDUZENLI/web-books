11. Show, that for a perspective transform, line segments that start in the view volume do map to line segments in the canonical volume after homogenization. Further, show that the relative ordering of points on the two segments is the same. Hint: Show that the $f(t)$ in Equation (7.8) has the properties $f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1$, the derivative of $f$ is positive for all $t \in [0, 1]$, and the homogeneous coordinate does not change sign.
