      "summary": "<p><strong>Core Idea:</strong> Computers use math to build, color, and move pictures of 3D things so they look real on screens in games, movies, and tools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Concepts / Formulas:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Modeling:</strong> Describe any object with points, curves, and surface rules. Example: store a car as thousands of connected points and how shiny its paint is.</li>\n  <li><strong>Rendering:</strong> Turn points into a colored picture with light and shadows. Example: make a 3D apple look red, round, and glossy.</li>\n  <li><strong>Animation:</strong> Change the model over time and render many pictures quickly. Example: make a character wave or run smoothly at 60 pictures per second.</li>\n  <li><strong>Graphics API:</strong> Toolkits like OpenGL or Direct3D that let your code draw fast on any computer or phone.</li>\n  <li><strong>Graphics Pipeline:</strong> Fast factory inside the graphics card that takes triangles, moves them to screen position, shades them, and hides what is behind. Example: every game on your phone uses this to draw millions of triangles per second.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Visual / Practical Example:</strong> A video game character: points define the body (modeling), light and texture make skin and clothes look real (rendering), changing the arm positions 60 times a second makes it wave (animation), all drawn instantly by the graphics pipeline using OpenGL.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Connections:</strong> Everything in games, movies, VR, medical scans, and design software starts here: modeling creates the objects, rendering makes them visible, animation makes them move, and the pipeline + API make it run fast on real hardware.</p>\n\n<p><strong>One-Sentence Summary:</strong> Computer graphics turns math descriptions of 3D objects into fast, beautiful, moving pictures using modeling, rendering, animation, and the graphics pipeline.</p>"
